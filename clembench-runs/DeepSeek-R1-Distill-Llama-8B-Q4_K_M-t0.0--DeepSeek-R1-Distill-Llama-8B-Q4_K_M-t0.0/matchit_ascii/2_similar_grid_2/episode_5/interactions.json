Let's consider potential structures:\n  - **Option A:** Same structure with identical rows but maybe a different arrangement.\n  - **Option B:** Different starting points or column-wise variations.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Row Structure:** My grid has Rows 1 and 5 identical, Rows 2 and 4 identical, and Row 3 fully blocked.\n2. **Column Structure:** Columns 1 and 5 have similar patterns with Xs except the middle row; Column 3 is all blocks.\n\n**Potential Differences:**\n- If the third row in the other grid isn't fully blocked, this would be a key difference.\n- Variations in column-wise placement of Xs and blocks could differ from mine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo confirm if both grids match, we can compare each row's structure and column patterns. If all corresponding rows and columns are identical, then the grids are the same. Otherwise, they may differ based on these elements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the structural analysis, your grid and mine could be the same if all corresponding rows and columns match identically.
