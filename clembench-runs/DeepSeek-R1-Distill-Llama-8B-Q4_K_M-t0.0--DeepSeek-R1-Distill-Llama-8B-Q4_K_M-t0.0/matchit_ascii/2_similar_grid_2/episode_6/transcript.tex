	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

	 To determine whether the two grids are identical based on their descriptions, let's analyze the key features of each grid and compare them.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Grid A:**\\ \tt - A 5x5 grid with Xs placed as follows:\\ \tt   - Row 1: X at columns 1 and 5\\ \tt   - Row 2: X at columns 2 and 4\\ \tt   - Rows 3, 4, 5: X at column 3\\ \tt \\ \tt **Key Features of Grid A:**\\ \tt 1. **Symmetry in Ends**: The first row has Xs on both ends (columns 1 and 5).\\ \tt 2. **Vertical Line in Middle Column**: Columns 3 from rows 3 to 5 form a vertical line of three Xs.\\ \tt 3. **Xs in Rows 3-5**: A single X centered vertically from rows 3 through 5.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Grid B:**\\ \tt - Described by the user but not yet viewed.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Comparison Strategy:**\\ \tt - **Symmetry Check**: Look for symmetric placement of Xs, especially in the first few rows.\\ \tt - **Vertical Line Presence**: Verify if columns 3 have three consecutive Xs starting from row 3.\\ \tt - **X Positions**: Note whether Row 2 has Xs at columns 2 and 4 and if Row 1 has Xs on both ends.\\ \tt \\ \tt By focusing on these points, we can identify differences or similarities effectively.
