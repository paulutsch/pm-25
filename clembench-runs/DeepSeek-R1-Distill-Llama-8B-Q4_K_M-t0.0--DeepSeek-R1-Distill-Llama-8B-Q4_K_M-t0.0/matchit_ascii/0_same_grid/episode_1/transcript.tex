	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X

	 To determine if the grids match, let's compare key elements step-by-step:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Grid Structure**: \\ \tt    - Your grid has 5 rows and 5 columns.\\ \tt    - The first four rows each have five symbols: [X, X, X, X] in Columns 3 only.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Row Comparison**:\\ \tt    - **Row1-4**: In my grid, these rows have the same pattern with an X in Column3 and ▢ elsewhere.\\ \tt    - If your grid's first four rows don't have this X in Column3 or differ otherwise, they may not match.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Fifth Row Analysis**:\\ \tt    - My fifth row is all Xs (5 Xs).\\ \tt    - If your fifth row doesn't match this exactly, the grids are different.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Column Analysis**:\\ \tt    - **Columns1-2 and 4-5**: In my grid, these columns have ▢ in rows1-4 and X in row5.\\ \tt    - If any of these don't align in your grid, there's a mismatch.\\ \tt    - **Column3**: Entirely X across all rows in my grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Questions to Ask the Other Person**:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Can you confirm the number of rows and columns in your grid?\\ \tt - Does each of the first four rows have an X only in the third column, with ▢ elsewhere?\\ \tt - Is the fifth row entirely composed of Xs?\\ \tt - In Columns1,2,4,5: Are the elements ▢ in the first four rows and X in the fifth row?\\ \tt - Does Column3 have Xs in all five rows?\\ \tt \\ \tt By addressing these points, we can identify if our grids are the same or different.
