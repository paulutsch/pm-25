	 DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid where all the edges (top, bottom, left, right) and the center square are Xs. Between these, in the middle three rows, only the first and last columns have Xs; the rest of the cells in those rows and the central area are filled with ▢s, forming a cross shape.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, your description is: The grid is 5x5, with all edges being Xs. In the middle three rows (rows2-4), only the first and last columns have Xs; everything else in these rows is ▢. Additionally, the center square at row3,col3 is an ▢. This creates a cross made up of Xs on the borders and ▢s inside, including the central area.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your description is: The grid is a 5x5 square with Xs forming the outermost layer (top, bottom, left, right) and the center square. In the middle three rows and columns, only the edges are Xs; the rest of those areas and the center are filled with ▢s, creating a cross shape.\\ \tt \\ \tt My grid is: A 5x5 grid where the borders (all around) and the center are Xs. The interior between these borders in the middle three rows is filled with ▢s, except for the center square which is also an ▢. This forms a cross made by overlapping Xs on the edges and in the center.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, both grids seem to match your description of a 5x5 cross with Xs on the outer borders and center, and ▢s elsewhere inside. Do you agree they are the same?

	 The two grids described are different based on the number of filled symbols in their middle rows. My grid has three filled symbols per middle row, while the user's grid has five, leading to a conclusion that the grids are not identical.\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: The grids differ in the number of filled squares in the middle rows, so they are not identical.
