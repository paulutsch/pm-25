What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Wait, but if I'm already in the Dining Room, does that mean I've found it? Hmm, maybe the user wants me to move from another room into it. Let me check the context.\n\nIn the example provided, once you entered the target room (Bedroom), you answered with \"DONE.\" So if the current room is the Dining Room and that's the target, then I should respond with \"DONE\" as well.\n\nBut wait, sometimes the initial position might not be the target. Oh no, in this case, the user says: The target room is Dining room. You are in Dining room... So yes, I'm already there. Therefore, the correct response is DONE.\n"}}], "created": 1748439284, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 15:34:44.838639", "call_duration": "0:00:07.573955", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
