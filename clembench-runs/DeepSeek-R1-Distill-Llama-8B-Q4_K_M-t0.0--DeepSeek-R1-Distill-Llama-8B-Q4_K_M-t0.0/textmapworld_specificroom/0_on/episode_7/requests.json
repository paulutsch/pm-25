Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Let me see where they're starting from and how they can move around.\n\nThey just entered the Game Room, right? But wait, if they're already in the target room, do they need to go anywhere else? The problem says once they've found the target room, they should answer with \"DONE\". So maybe the next step is to confirm that they're done here. \n\nLooking back at their last message, it says they entered the Game Room and the available directions are west. Hmm, so perhaps they moved into the Game Room from another direction. But now that they're inside, the only option is to go west. So maybe moving west from the Game Room could take them somewhere else, but since the target is already achieved, they might not need to explore further.\n\nWait, noâ€”the target room is where they need to end up. If they're in the Game Room, then the task is complete. They should respond \"DONE\" because they've arrived at their destination.\n"}}], "created": 1748439270, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 231, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 450, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 15:34:30.590903", "call_duration": "0:00:09.597176", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
