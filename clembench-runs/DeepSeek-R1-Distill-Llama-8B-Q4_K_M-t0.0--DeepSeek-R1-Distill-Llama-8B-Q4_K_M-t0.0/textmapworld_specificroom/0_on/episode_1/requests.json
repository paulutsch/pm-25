Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Basement. You are in the Basement. Currently available directions: east, north, south.

Wait, but hold on, if I'm already in the Basement, that might complicate things because sometimes being in the target room can confuse the process.\n\nLet me go back. The user mentioned the target room is the Basement. Currently, I'm in the Basement, and available directions are east, north, south. So my goal is to either find a way out or confirm if I've already reached the target. But the example shows that once you step into the target room, you answer DONE. So maybe if I'm already in the Basement, I should just answer DONE.\n\nBut wait, could there be another layer where perhaps moving within the Basement might lead me somewhere else? The available directions suggest east, north, south. Maybe moving east leads to a different part of the Basement or an exit. Or north and south might loop back or take me further away.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm already in the target room, maybe the initial step was just entering it, so the next move would be to confirm by answering DONE. That makes sense because the example provided that once you enter the target room, you answer DONE after moving into it.\n\nSo my instruction would be to just say DONE without moving again since I'm already there. Or perhaps the directions are misleading, and I actually need to move within the Basement, but according to the problem statement, once found, answer DONE.\n"}}], "created": 1748439141, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 308, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 529, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 15:32:21.595036", "call_duration": "0:00:12.812090", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
