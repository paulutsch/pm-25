Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

What is your next instruction?\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-ngv3bswwtp0bqlewo8qnr", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nDONE", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get from where I am right now to the target room, which is the Studio. Wait, hold on, if I'm already in the Studio, does that mean I've found it? Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe user says: \"The target room is Studio. You are in the Studio.\" So actually, am I already in the Studio? If that's the case, then maybe the task is done because I'm already there. But that seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe I misunderstood something about the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I was in another room before and had to move into the Studio. But the initial statement says I'm currently in the Studio. So does that mean the goal is already achieved without any moves? That would make sense because the example they provided ends with \"DONE\" once it reaches the target room.\n\nWait, looking at their example: When you enter the Bedroom and there are no available directions except south, the next instruction was DONE. So similarly, if I'm in the Studio now, maybe the task is completed, and I should respond with DONE.\n\nBut perhaps I need to confirm if being in the Studio is indeed the target without any further moves required. Since the problem states that I am in the Studio, it's likely the target is reached, so I just need to say DONE.\n"}}], "created": 1748439170, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 291, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 510, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 15:32:50.534083", "call_duration": "0:00:12.090471", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
