Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Right now, I'm already in the Living Room, and the directions available are south and north. Hmm, where should I go?\n\nFirst, let me visualize the layout. If I'm in the Living Room, going north or south would take me to different adjacent rooms. I don't know what's beyond each direction yet, so maybe I need to check both possibilities.\n\nIf I choose south first, that might lead me somewhere else. Alternatively, choosing north could be another route. But wait, since the target room is already here, does that mean I should just confirm I'm in the right place? Or do I have to explore other rooms and then come back?\n\nThe goal is to enter the target room, which is the Living Room. So maybe as soon as I realize I'm in it, I can say DONE. But how do I know I've arrived? Perhaps I need to check if any of the available directions would lead me away from the target.\n\nWait, the current position is the Living Room, so moving north or south might take me out of it into other rooms. If I move in a direction and end up somewhere else, then the next step should be to return. But if I'm already here, perhaps the task is done once I recognize my location.\n\nBut according to the example provided earlier, when they entered the target room, the available directions were south, but after moving north, it led them to another room before getting back. Maybe the system needs to prompt further moves until the target is confirmed.\n\nWait no, in the example, after entering the Bedroom, the next instruction was DONE because that was the target. So perhaps once I'm in the target room, regardless of available directions, the task is done. But maybe the system requires me to confirm by not moving anymore.\n\nSo in this case, since the Living Room is the target, when I enter it, I should answer with DONE without moving further.\n"}}], "created": 1748439236, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 419, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 640, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 15:33:56.349382", "call_duration": "0:00:17.506431", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
