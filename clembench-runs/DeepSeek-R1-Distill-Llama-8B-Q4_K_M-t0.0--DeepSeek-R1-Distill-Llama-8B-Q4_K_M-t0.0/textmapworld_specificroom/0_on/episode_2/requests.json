Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Conservatory. You are in the Conservatory. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-khj031uzvsjvs9656hn52t", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nDONE", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to get from the current room to the target room, which is the Conservatory. Wait, hold on, the user said we're already in the Conservatory? Let me make sure I understand correctly.\n\nThe last message says: \"You are in the Conservatory.\" And currently available direction is south. So, my next move should be to go south from here. But wait, if we're in the Conservatory and the target is also the Conservatory, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it means I'm already there, so the task is done.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the example shows that when you've found the target room, you answer with \"DONE.\" So in this case, if we're starting in the Conservatory and that's the target, then maybe the initial step is to check if we're already there. If so, we can just say DONE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended a different setup where movement from another room leads into the Conservatory as the target. But according to the current information, the starting point is the Conservatory and the direction available is south. So moving south from Conservatory would take us somewhere else, but our target is the same room, so maybe it's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant that we're starting in another room and need to get to the Conservatory. But no, the initial statement says: \"The target room is Conservatory. You are in the Conservatory.\" So yes, I'm already there. Therefore, the correct response should be DONE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. The example starts with being in one room and moving to another until finding the target. But here, we're told that the target is the Conservatory and we are in it. So I think the answer is indeed DONE.\n"}}], "created": 1748439154, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 387, "prompt_tokens": 219, "total_tokens": 606, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 15:32:34.410212", "call_duration": "0:00:16.120006", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
