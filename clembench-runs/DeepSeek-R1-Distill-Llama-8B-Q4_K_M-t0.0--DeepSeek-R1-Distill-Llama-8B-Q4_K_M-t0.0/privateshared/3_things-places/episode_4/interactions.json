Here are some hints: LEFT is piano, RIGHT is hedgehog. ASIDE: Based on the given directions and items, if you're asked about something on your right, it would typically be associated with a specific location.\n\nME: Since each direction corresponds to an item, I can confirm that **no**, the questioner doesn't know what's on your right specifically because they need the information provided. ASIDE: In this setup, each direction has its own unique item, so without prior knowledge of these associations, the questioner wouldn't know what's on your right.\n\nME: To determine if the questioner knows what's on your right, I can tell them that **no**, because they don't have the specific information about your right-hand side. ASIDE: Without knowing the setup of objects in directions, one couldn't definitively say what's on someone's right.\n\nME: If asked, **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on my right, as it would depend on the specific arrangement you've given. ASIDE: Unless told otherwise, anyone wouldn't inherently know what's on your right; it's relative to your setup.\n\nME: The answer is **no**, because without knowing your right-hand side item, the questioner can't confirm it. ASIDE: Right items are unique and specific based on direction, so unless you tell them, they don't know.\n\nME: **No**, the questioner doesn't know what's on your right as it depends on the given items. ASIDE: Without knowing the setup, the answer isn't clear; each direction has its own item.\n\nME: The answer is **no** because the questioner would need to know about my specific right side. ASIDE: Directions have unique items assigned, so without that knowledge, one can't know what's on your right.\n\nME: **No**, the questioner doesn't know your right item unless you tell them. ASIDE: Unless they're told, it remains unknown; each direction has its own specified object.\n\nME: To answer whether the questioner knows your right-hand side item: **no**, because that information isn't provided yet. ASIDE: Unless informed about your right, one can't know which specific item is there.\n\nME: The answer is **no**—they don't know what's on your right without prior knowledge. ASIDE: Since each direction has a unique item, without knowing the setup, the answer isn't possible.\n\nME: If asked, I'd have to say **no**, because they need to know the specific arrangement of items on my right. ASIDE: Without that information, it's not known; directions correspond to unique items.\n\nME: The correct response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't know your right-hand side item without being told. ASIDE: Unless you provide the details, each direction has its own specific object.\n\nME: When asked if the questioner knows what's on your right, the answer would be **no** because that information isn't provided yet. ASIDE: Directions map to unique items, so unless they're told, it remains unknown.\n\nME: The response is **no**, as the questioner needs to know about the item on your right for them to confirm it. ASIDE: Without knowing each direction's assigned object, one can't answer definitively.\n\nME: I'll respond with **no**, because without knowing the specific arrangement of items on your right, they can't confirm it. ASIDE: Each direction corresponds to a unique object; thus, knowledge is needed for an accurate answer.\n\nME: The final answer is **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on your right unless it's specified. ASIDE: Without knowing the exact item assigned to each direction, they can't provide that information.\n\nME: Yes, based on the given directions, if you're on my right with specific items, but the questioner likely **does** not know without prior knowledge. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely, so unless told, they don't know what's there.\n\nME: The answer is **no**, as the questioner needs to be told about your right-hand side item for them to know it. ASIDE: Unless provided with that info, directions' items remain unknown.\n\nME: To determine if they know your right, the answer is **no**—they don't unless informed. ASIDE: Without knowledge of your setup, it's impossible to tell what's on your right.\n\nME: Yes, if the item on my right is a hedgehog as per the clues, but without that information, the questioner likely doesn't know. ASIDE: Based on the given directions, your right has a specific item, so yes, they might not know unless told.\n\nME: The answer is **no**, because without knowing what's assigned to your right side based on the setup, the questioner can't confirm it. ASIDE: Each direction corresponds uniquely, so knowledge is necessary.\n\nME: Based on the given directions, if someone asks about something being on their right, they'd know; otherwise, **no**. ASIDE: Unless you provide details, it's unclear; each direction has its own item.\n\nME: If I were asked, I'd say **yes**, because based on your clues, your right has a specific item.

ASIDE: Without knowing which object is assigned to your right, it's unknown.\n\nME: Based on the direction mapping, if someone knows their right side corresponds to a hedgehog, they can answer accordingly. ASIDE: Each direction has its own unique item, so knowledge allows identification.\n\nME: The response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't know what's on your right without being told. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely; thus, knowledge is required.\n\nME: Yes, based on the setup, if someone knows that RIGHT corresponds to an object like a hedgehog, they can confirm it. ASIDE: Direction assignments allow for knowing items in specific places.\n\nME: To answer whether the questioner knows your right, I'd say **no**, because that information hasn't been provided yet. ASIDE: Directions correspond to unique objects; thus, knowledge is needed.\n\nME: The correct response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't have access to your right-hand side item unless told. ASIDE: Without knowing which direction corresponds to which object, it's unclear.\n\nME: If I were asked, I'd say **yes**, because based on direction assignments, your right has a specific object. ASIDE: From the given data, each position has its own item, so knowledge is possible.\n\nME: The answer is **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on your right unless it's specified in the setup. ASIDE: Directions have unique items assigned, so without knowing their positions, they can't be identified.\n\nME: Based on the given information, yes, I'd say something is on your right; for example, a hedgehog as per RIGHT. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely, allowing identification of objects in specific places.\n\nME: The answer is **no**, because the questioner hasn't been told about what's on your right side. ASIDE: Each direction has its own unique item, so unless they're informed, they can't know.\n\nME: If I had to tell them, I'd say **no**—they don't know yet what's on your right. ASIDE: Directions correspond to specific objects; thus, knowledge is needed for an answer.\n\nME: The final response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't have access to that information yet. ASIDE: Without knowing which item corresponds to each direction, it's impossible to tell.\n\nME: I think the answer is **yes**, because based on the setup, there's a specific item assigned to your right side.
