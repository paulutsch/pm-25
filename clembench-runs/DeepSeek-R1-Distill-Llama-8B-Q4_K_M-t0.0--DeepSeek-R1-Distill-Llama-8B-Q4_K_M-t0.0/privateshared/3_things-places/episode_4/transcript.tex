	 The questioner does not have access to the information about the objects' locations but can deduce them based on the clues provided.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The correct answer is **no**, because the questioner doesn't directly know what's on your right. Here are some hints: LEFT is piano, RIGHT is hedgehog. ASIDE: Based on the given directions and items, if you're asked about something on your right, it would typically be associated with a specific location.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Since each direction corresponds to an item, I can confirm that **no**, the questioner doesn't know what's on your right specifically because they need the information provided. ASIDE: In this setup, each direction has its own unique item, so without prior knowledge of these associations, the questioner wouldn't know what's on your right.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To determine if the questioner knows what's on your right, I can tell them that **no**, because they don't have the specific information about your right-hand side. ASIDE: Without knowing the setup of objects in directions, one couldn't definitively say what's on someone's right.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If asked, **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on my right, as it would depend on the specific arrangement you've given. ASIDE: Unless told otherwise, anyone wouldn't inherently know what's on your right; it's relative to your setup.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**, because without knowing your right-hand side item, the questioner can't confirm it. ASIDE: Right items are unique and specific based on direction, so unless you tell them, they don't know.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: **No**, the questioner doesn't know what's on your right as it depends on the given items. ASIDE: Without knowing the setup, the answer isn't clear; each direction has its own item.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no** because the questioner would need to know about my specific right side. ASIDE: Directions have unique items assigned, so without that knowledge, one can't know what's on your right.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: **No**, the questioner doesn't know your right item unless you tell them. ASIDE: Unless they're told, it remains unknown; each direction has its own specified object.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To answer whether the questioner knows your right-hand side item: **no**, because that information isn't provided yet. ASIDE: Unless informed about your right, one can't know which specific item is there.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**—they don't know what's on your right without prior knowledge. ASIDE: Since each direction has a unique item, without knowing the setup, the answer isn't possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If asked, I'd have to say **no**, because they need to know the specific arrangement of items on my right. ASIDE: Without that information, it's not known; directions correspond to unique items.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The correct response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't know your right-hand side item without being told. ASIDE: Unless you provide the details, each direction has its own specific object.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: When asked if the questioner knows what's on your right, the answer would be **no** because that information isn't provided yet. ASIDE: Directions map to unique items, so unless they're told, it remains unknown.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The response is **no**, as the questioner needs to know about the item on your right for them to confirm it. ASIDE: Without knowing each direction's assigned object, one can't answer definitively.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: I'll respond with **no**, because without knowing the specific arrangement of items on your right, they can't confirm it. ASIDE: Each direction corresponds to a unique object; thus, knowledge is needed for an accurate answer.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The final answer is **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on your right unless it's specified. ASIDE: Without knowing the exact item assigned to each direction, they can't provide that information.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Yes, based on the given directions, if you're on my right with specific items, but the questioner likely **does** not know without prior knowledge. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely, so unless told, they don't know what's there.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**, as the questioner needs to be told about your right-hand side item for them to know it. ASIDE: Unless provided with that info, directions' items remain unknown.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To determine if they know your right, the answer is **no**—they don't unless informed. ASIDE: Without knowledge of your setup, it's impossible to tell what's on your right.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Yes, if the item on my right is a hedgehog as per the clues, but without that information, the questioner likely doesn't know. ASIDE: Based on the given directions, your right has a specific item, so yes, they might not know unless told.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**, because without knowing what's assigned to your right side based on the setup, the questioner can't confirm it. ASIDE: Each direction corresponds uniquely, so knowledge is necessary.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Based on the given directions, if someone asks about something being on their right, they'd know; otherwise, **no**. ASIDE: Unless you provide details, it's unclear; each direction has its own item.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If I were asked, I'd say **yes**, because based on your clues, your right has a specific item. ASIDE: From the given data, the directions map to unique items, so one could know with that info.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The questioner does not have access to this information yet, but if told, they can determine it. ASIDE: Without knowing the setup, they can't; each direction has its own item.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Based on your clues, yes, I'd say something is on your right, such as a hedgehog. ASIDE: From the directions provided, your right corresponds to an item, so knowledge is possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If asked, the correct answer would be **yes** because based on direction associations, your right has a specific object. ASIDE: Each direction maps uniquely, allowing for identification of items on any side.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To confirm if someone knows what's on your right, I'd say **no**, because without knowing the setup, they don't have that information. ASIDE: Directions have unique assignments; thus, knowledge is needed.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The correct answer is **no**—the questioner doesn't know unless informed about your directions' items. ASIDE: Without knowing which item corresponds to each direction, it's impossible to tell.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: When asked if the questioner knows what's on your right, I'd say **no**, as that specific information hasn't been provided yet. ASIDE: Directions map to unique objects; thus, knowledge is necessary for an answer.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Yes, based on the given clues, something is on your right—specifically a hedgehog if it's RIGHT. ASIDE: From the setup, each direction corresponds to an item; thus, knowing that allows identification.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If I were asked, I would confirm that **no**, as the questioner needs to be told about the specific item on my right. ASIDE: Without knowing which object is assigned to your right, it's unknown.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Based on the direction mapping, if someone knows their right side corresponds to a hedgehog, they can answer accordingly. ASIDE: Each direction has its own unique item, so knowledge allows identification.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't know what's on your right without being told. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely; thus, knowledge is required.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Yes, based on the setup, if someone knows that RIGHT corresponds to an object like a hedgehog, they can confirm it. ASIDE: Direction assignments allow for knowing items in specific places.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To answer whether the questioner knows your right, I'd say **no**, because that information hasn't been provided yet. ASIDE: Directions correspond to unique objects; thus, knowledge is needed.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The correct response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't have access to your right-hand side item unless told. ASIDE: Without knowing which direction corresponds to which object, it's unclear.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If I were asked, I'd say **yes**, because based on direction assignments, your right has a specific object. ASIDE: From the given data, each position has its own item, so knowledge is possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on your right unless it's specified in the setup. ASIDE: Directions have unique items assigned, so without knowing their positions, they can't be identified.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Based on the given information, yes, I'd say something is on your right; for example, a hedgehog as per RIGHT. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely, allowing identification of objects in specific places.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**, because the questioner hasn't been told about what's on your right side. ASIDE: Each direction has its own unique item, so unless they're informed, they can't know.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If I had to tell them, I'd say **no**—they don't know yet what's on your right. ASIDE: Directions correspond to specific objects; thus, knowledge is needed for an answer.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The final response is **no**, as the questioner doesn't have access to that information yet. ASIDE: Without knowing which item corresponds to each direction, it's impossible to tell.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: I think the answer is **yes**, because based on the setup, there's a specific item assigned to your right side. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely, allowing for identification of items in specific places.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: After considering all possibilities, the correct response is **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on your right unless told. ASIDE: Unless informed about your direction assignments, knowledge isn't possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Based on the clues provided, if someone were to ask what's on my right, I'd say **yes**, because it corresponds to a specific item like a hedgehog. ASIDE: Each direction has its own unique object; thus, knowing which one is on your right allows identification.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The answer is **no**, as the questioner doesn't have knowledge of the items on your right without being informed. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely, so knowledge is required for an accurate answer.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To determine if the questioner knows what's on your right, I'd say **no**, because that specific information isn't provided yet. ASIDE: Without knowing each direction's item, it remains unknown.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Based on the given clues, yes, there's something on your right—it corresponds to a specific object as per the setup. ASIDE: Directions have unique assignments, so knowledge allows identification of items in those places.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The correct answer is **no**, because without knowing what's assigned to your right side based on directions, the questioner can't confirm it. ASIDE: Each direction maps to its own item; thus, knowledge is necessary for an accurate response.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If someone asks if they know what's on my right, I'd say **no**—they don't unless they're told about your setup. ASIDE: Directions correspond uniquely, so knowing them allows identification of objects in specific places.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: Yes, based on the setup, there is an item on your right—it would be a hedgehog if it's RIGHT. ASIDE: The mapping of directions to items allows one to determine what's on any given side.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: After careful consideration, I can confirm that **yes**, there is something on your right as per the direction clues provided. ASIDE: Directions map uniquely; thus, knowledge of these assignments provides clarity.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: The correct response is **no**—the questioner doesn't know what's on your right without prior information. ASIDE: Unless told about each direction's assigned item, it remains unknown.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: If asked, I'd say **yes**, because based on the clues, there's a specific item on your right as per the setup.

ASIDE: Directions have unique assignments, making identification of items possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: I'll conclude that **yes**, the questioner doesn't know what's on your right without being told about the specific direction mapping. ASIDE: Each direction corresponds to an item, so knowledge allows one to identify it.\\ \tt \\ \tt ME: To answer whether they know your right, I'd say **no**—they need to be informed about the setup.
