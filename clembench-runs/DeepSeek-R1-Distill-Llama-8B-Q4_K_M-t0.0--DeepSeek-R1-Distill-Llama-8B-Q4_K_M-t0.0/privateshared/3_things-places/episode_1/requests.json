So the questioner doesn't know their surroundings, but they might be trying to figure it out by asking questions.\n\nI need to determine if knowing what's on someone's left requires them to have knowledge of their position relative to the other objects. Since LEFT is daisy, and the user (questioner) doesn't have that information yet, perhaps the answer is no because the questioner hasn't been told about the daisy being on their left.\n\nBut I should also consider how much context the questioner has. Maybe they've already been given some information about their location relative to other objects like watermelon and camellia, but not necessarily the ones on their left or right.\n\nWait, no—watermelon is marked as HERE, which suggests that it's at the current position of the questioner, and camellia is THERE. So, if someone is asking about what's on their left, they might not know unless they've been told that daisy is to their left.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since the questioner doesn't have information about the objects relative to their own position beyond watermelon being here and camellia there, they wouldn't know what's on their left.
