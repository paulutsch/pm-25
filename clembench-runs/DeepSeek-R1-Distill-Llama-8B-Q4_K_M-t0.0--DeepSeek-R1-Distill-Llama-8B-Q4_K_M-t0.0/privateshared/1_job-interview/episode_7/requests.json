Let me see... The user mentioned in their CV that they have a bachelor's degree in informatics. But they also said the recruiter doesn't know about it yet. Hmm, that’s interesting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context here. It seems like the applicant is applying for a job and provided some details about themselves through their CV. The key points from the CV are: Bachelor of Informatics, 15 years of industry experience, highest education is bachelor's degree, can speak French, and available tomorrow.\n\nThe question from the interviewer is asking if the interviewer knows about the applicant's bachelor's degree. So, the user needs to respond with a yes or no and then stop. But how do they determine whether the interviewer knows or not?\n\nWell, the CV was mentioned as part of the job application, but it’s unclear if this information has been shared with the recruiter yet. The user said the recruiter doesn't know about it yet. So that suggests that the CV hasn’t been provided to the recruiter at that point in time.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"Does the interviewer know...?\" Assuming that the interviewer refers to the recruiter or someone else who has access to the CV. If the CV hasn't been shared, then it's likely the interviewer doesn't know about their bachelor's degree yet.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's another interpretation where the interviewer might have access to the CV before it's officially shared. Maybe in some cases, recruiters share CVs internally or preliminary information. But given that the user specifies the recruiter doesn't know about it yet, it's safer to assume they don’t have that information.\n\nSo, putting this all together, since the CV hasn’t been provided to the recruiter yet, it’s reasonable to say that the interviewer doesn't know about their bachelor's degree.\n\nNow, I need to make sure my answer is just a yes or no and stops. So, it should be something like: \"No, the recruiter does not know about my bachelor's degree yet.\"\n"}}], "created": 1748460020, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 451, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 630, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T21:20:52.813123", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an applicant in a job interview.
