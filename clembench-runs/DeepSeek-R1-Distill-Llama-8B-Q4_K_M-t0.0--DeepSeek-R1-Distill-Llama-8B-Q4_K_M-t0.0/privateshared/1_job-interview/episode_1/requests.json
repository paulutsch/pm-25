However, the question is specifically about whether they told the recruiter about their bachelor course.\n\nI should consider if the applicant has any reason to mention their Bachelor's course in this context. Since the focus is on job application specifics, perhaps it's not necessary unless the recruiter asks directly.\n\nBut since the user wants a specific response: yes or no and stop, I have to decide based on what makes sense.\n"}}], "created": 1748459621, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 372, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 550, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T21:14:08.852524", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an applicant in a job interview.
