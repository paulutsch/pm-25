The question is asking whether I've informed the recruiter about my bachelor's course. I need to answer this clearly.\n\nFirst, I should recall what information was given in my CV. Looking back, my CV mentions that I have a Bachelor's degree in Engineering, and it's been three years since I finished. It also notes other skills like Spanish and availability during the last week of January.\n\nNow, the key part is whether I've told the recruiter about my specific bachelor's course. Did I mention which course or field it was in? In my CV, it just says Bachelor of Engineering without specifying the course. So, if the recruiter is asking specifically about a particular course, like Mechanical Engineering or something else, I might not have provided that detail.\n\nI should consider whether mentioning the specific course was included. From what I remember, I only listed the degree but didn't elaborate on the course title or focus area. Therefore, I probably haven't told them in-depth about the bachelor's course unless it was mentioned elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, maybe there was a section where I could have elaborated more. Did I include any academic projects or relevant coursework? If not, then I might not have given specifics about the course beyond its degree title.\n\nSo, if the recruiter is asking specifically about a certain aspect of my bachelor's studies, like a specific module or area of focus, and I haven't provided that information in my CV, then my answer would be no.\n\nHowever, if the question is just asking whether I informed them that I have a bachelor's degree, even without specifics, then yes, I did mention it. But based on the context given, the question seems to be more detailed, asking about the specific course, so I think it's safe to say I haven't told them in detail about my bachelor's course.\n\nIn summary, since my CV doesn't specify a particular course within the Bachelor of Engineering, I probably haven't informed the recruiter about it in depth. So my answer should be no.\n"}}], "created": 1748459911, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 445, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 623, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T21:18:56.338307", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an applicant in a job interview.
