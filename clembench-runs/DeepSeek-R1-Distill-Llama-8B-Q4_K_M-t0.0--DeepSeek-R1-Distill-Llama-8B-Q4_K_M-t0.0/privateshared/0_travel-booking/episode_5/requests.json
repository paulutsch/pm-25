The initial setup was that the travel agent doesn't know about this booking yet.\n\nThe current query is ME: asking if the travel agent already knows the origin (Prague). I need to answer this with just \"yes\" or \"no\" and then stop. But wait, in the previous interaction, when the user said \"ME: Please answer this question carefully.

The user is playing a customer who wants to make this booking, and the travel agent doesn't know about it yet. So if the agent isn't aware of the booking, then they certainly don't know the origin. Therefore, answering \"Yes\" would mean that the agent does know, which contradicts the setup.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.
