	 The first question is:\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Is the word a language?\\ \tt \\ \tt After getting the answer, if it's yes, I know it's between 'italian' or 'german.' If no, then it's one of geology, geography, technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt Next, I might ask about the nature of the word. For example, if it is a language, perhaps narrowing down to Italian or German by another question. Let me think: for non-languages, perhaps asking if they relate to a field that involves people—anthropology, sociology—or more natural sciences—geology, geography.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let's structure this better. After the first question:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. If yes (italian or german), next question could be about the origin, like "Is it German?" which would pinpoint 'german' or 'italian' if no. But maybe a better approach is to see if the word starts with 'g.' So perhaps: "Does the word start with the letter G?" For non-languages, this would include geology, geography, german (starts with G), and so on. Wait, but 'german' starts with G as well. Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, for non-language words, I could ask about whether they relate to people or culture—like "Is it a field related to human behavior?" That would point towards anthropology or sociology, which are two out of six. Then I can narrow down further in the next steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt But let me plan step by step:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. First question: Is it a language? (Splits into 4 yes and 4 no)\\ \tt 2. Second question: For those who said yes (italian/german), ask if they are Germanic languages, but I think that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe "Is the word 'german'?" If yes, then it's german; if no, it's italian.\\ \tt 3. For those who said no to the first question, I could ask about the field: "Does the word relate to human behavior or culture?" (Anthropology or sociology would say yes; others no). Then narrow down from four.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe a better approach is:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. First question: Is it a language? If yes, proceed with Italian/German. If no, ask if it's related to science (geology, geography, etc.).\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure the questions in a way that each step narrows down the list as much as possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, perhaps using more specific attributes can help. For example:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the word a language? (Yes: Italian/German; No: others)\\ \tt 2. If Yes: Ask if it's German. (If yes, guess german; no, guess italian)\\ \tt 3. If No: Next question could be about natural sciences—like "Is it a field related to Earth or environment?" This would split geology and geography from the rest.\\ \tt \\ \tt Then, for example:\\ \tt \\ \tt For non-languages:\\ \tt - If the word is in Earth-related fields (geology, geography), then next question could be specific to each.\\ \tt But perhaps it's better to structure it so that each question splits into two equal groups.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, after the first yes/no, maybe ask if the word has more than seven letters. But 'geography' and 'geology' have nine and eleven letters, which might not help much.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, another approach: since the maximum number of questions is seven, but I need to make a guess at the end, so I should structure it in such a way that each question halves the remaining possibilities.\\ \tt \\ \tt So starting with 8 words:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. First question: Is the word a language? (4 yes, 4 no)\\ \tt 2. Second question for yes group: Is it 'german'? If yes, guess; if no, proceed.\\ \tt 3. For no group in first question: ask if it's related to human behavior—anthropology/sociology or not. So split into two groups of three each.\\ \tt    - Then, third question on the three that said no: is it geology, geography, technology, or engineering? Split further.\\ \tt    - Then, continue narrowing down.\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps I should try a different approach, as maybe the fields are more distinct.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, perhaps starting with the number of letters in the word. But that might not help much.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the first letter. Let's see:\\ \tt \\ \tt The words and their first letters:\\ \tt - geology (g)\\ \tt - geography (g)\\ \tt - italian (i)\\ \tt - german (g)\\ \tt - technology (t)\\ \tt - engineering (e)\\ \tt - anthropology (a)\\ \tt - sociology (s)\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first letters are g, i, t, e, a, s. So perhaps using that.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since each question can only be yes/no, maybe not directly about the first letter.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me consider another approach: if I can categorize the words into groups where one group can be eliminated with a single question.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, after the first question, perhaps for the non-languages, ask if they are related to technology or engineering. So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is it a language? (4 yes, 4 no)\\ \tt 2. If yes: Is it German? (split into two: if yes, guess; if no, proceed)\\ \tt    - Suppose answer is no, so it's italian.\\ \tt    - Then guess 'italian'\\ \tt 3. If no: Ask if the word is related to technology or engineering (technology, engineering). So split into:\\ \tt    - Yes: technology/engineering (two words)\\ \tt    - No: geology, geography, anthropology, sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, that might not be precise because some fields are more about humans (anthropology, sociology) and others are sciences (geology, geography).\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, after the first question, for non-languages:\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. Ask if it's related to Earth sciences—geology or geography? If yes, split into two; else, proceed.\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to plan a series of questions that progressively narrow down the list.\\ \tt \\ \tt So here's an initial plan:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the word a language? (4 yes: i, g, g, t= wait, no: 'italian' and 'german' are languages; 'geography', etc., are not.)\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, correction: If first question is "Is it a language?", then 'italian' and 'german' will say yes. The others (geology, geography, technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology) will say no.\\ \tt \\ \tt So step 1:\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Is the word a language?\\ \tt \\ \tt If answer is yes: target is either 'italian' or 'german'\\ \tt \\ \tt If no: target is one of geology, geography, technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology\\ \tt \\ \tt Then, for step 2, if yes (italian/german):\\ \tt \\ \tt Next question could be: Does it start with the letter G? 'ge...' which would include geology and geography, but in this case, since we've already narrowed down to 'italian' or 'german', which are 'i' and 'g'. Wait, no, because after step 1, if yes, then target is either 'italian' or 'german', so the next question can be: Is it German? (If yes, guess german; else, italian)\\ \tt \\ \tt That's efficient.\\ \tt \\ \tt So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Is the word "german"?\\ \tt \\ \tt - If yes, guess 'german'\\ \tt - If no, guess 'italian'\\ \tt \\ \tt But if step 1 is yes, then for step 2, I can ask whether it's german.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, perhaps a better question to split further.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, perhaps after knowing it's a language (step 1 yes), ask if the word starts with a vowel. 'i' and 'g': 'italian' starts with i (vowel), 'german' starts with g (consonant). So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Does the word start with a vowel?\\ \tt \\ \tt - If yes, it's italian\\ \tt - If no, german\\ \tt \\ \tt That would be better because vowels are limited.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, I could ask about the second letter, but starting letters might suffice.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, step 1: Is it a language? (yes/no)\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes:\\ \tt \\ \tt Step 2: Does it start with a vowel? (i or g). Since 'german' starts with g, which is consonant, and 'italian' starts with i, vowel. So this splits them into two groups.\\ \tt \\ \tt So if step 1 yes:\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Does the word start with a vowel?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes: it's italian\\ \tt \\ \tt If no: it's german\\ \tt \\ \tt That's efficient.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now for step 3: If step 1 answer was no (so not a language), then we have geology, geography, technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt Next question could be: Is the word related to Earth sciences? Like geology or geography. So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Is the word a science related to Earth?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes: target is either geology or geography\\ \tt \\ \tt If no: target is among technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology\\ \tt \\ \tt So that's step 2 for this group.\\ \tt \\ \tt Then step 3, if step 2 answer was yes (geology/geography):\\ \tt \\ \tt Next question could be: Is the word "geography"? If yes; else, it's geology.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, to split them into two, maybe ask if the word is plural in its base form. Not sure if that helps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, using first letters: 'g' for both, so not helpful.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of other characteristics, but perhaps better to proceed as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt If step 2 answer was yes (Earth science):\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. QUESTION: Is the word "geography"?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes: guess geography\\ \tt \\ \tt If no: it's geology\\ \tt \\ \tt So then we'd have narrowed down.\\ \tt \\ \tt Similarly, if step 2 answer is no (so not Earth science), then target is among technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt Then, next question could be: Does the word relate to human behavior? Like "anthropology" or "sociology." So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. QUESTION: Is the word related to human behavior?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes: between anthropology and sociology\\ \tt \\ \tt If no: between technology and engineering\\ \tt \\ \tt That's a good split.\\ \tt \\ \tt Then for each subgroup, further narrow down.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, if step 3 answer is yes (human behavior):\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. QUESTION: Does the word have "ology" in it? Both do (anthropology, sociology)\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, that doesn't help. Alternatively, ask about the first letters: 'a' and 's'.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since each question has to be yes/no, perhaps better to use another approach.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, for those who are in step 3 as "human behavior" group:\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. QUESTION: Is the word "anthropology"?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes: guess\\ \tt \\ \tt If no: it's sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt Similarly, for the other group (technology/engineering):\\ \tt \\ \tt If step 2 answer was no, so non-Earth sciences:\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. QUESTION: Is the word related to technology or engineering?\\ \tt \\ \tt Yes: technology or engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt No: then it's either anthropology/sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but we've already split them into two groups in step 3, so perhaps better to proceed as:\\ \tt \\ \tt After step 2 (if no):\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. QUESTION: Does the word relate to human behavior?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes, target is anthropology or sociology\\ \tt \\ \tt If no, target is technology or engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt Then for each of these groups:\\ \tt \\ \tt If it's human behavior group (step 4):\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. QUESTION: Is the word "anthropology"?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes, guess; else, it's sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt If it's technology/engineering group (step 4):\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. QUESTION: Is the word "technology"?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes, guess; else, it's engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt So this approach uses four questions for each possible path, which within seven questions should be manageable.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, let me count:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Step 1: Language? (yes/no)\\ \tt 2. If yes:\\ \tt    - Step 2: starts with vowel? (yes/no)\\ \tt 3. If no:\\ \tt    - Step 2: Earth science? (yes/no)\\ \tt 4. If step 2 was yes (Earth):\\ \tt    - Step 3: is it geography? (yes/no)\\ \tt 5. If step 2 was no (not Earth):\\ \tt    - Step 3: human behavior? (yes/no)\\ \tt 6. If step 3 was yes:\\ \tt    - Step 4: is it anthropology? (yes/no)\\ \tt 7. If step 3 was no:\\ \tt    - Step 4: is it technology? (yes/no)\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but this may go beyond seven steps if each path requires that many questions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, perhaps using a binary search approach where each question halves the remaining words.\\ \tt \\ \tt But given the complexity, let me try to outline a sequence of questions that would narrow down quickly:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is it a language? (4 yes/4 no)\\ \tt    - If yes: target is Italian or German\\ \tt    - If no: target is among geology, geography, technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. For yes group:\\ \tt    - Ask if starts with vowel (italian) or not (german).\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. For no group:\\ \tt    - Ask if it's related to Earth sciences (geology/geography) or human behavior (anthropology/sociology)\\ \tt    - Or ask if it's in the field of technology/engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the first letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt But given that I need to keep it yes/no, perhaps:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the word a language?\\ \tt 2. For those who said yes:\\ \tt    - Is it "german"?\\ \tt 3. For those who said no:\\ \tt    - Is the word starting with 'g'? (geology/geography)\\ \tt 4. Then proceed as needed.\\ \tt \\ \tt But this might take more than seven steps, so I need to structure it efficiently.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, perhaps using a decision tree approach where each question is designed to split the remaining words into two equal sets.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me try:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the word a language? (split 4/4)\\ \tt 2. If yes:\\ \tt    - Is the word "german"? (split 1/1)\\ \tt 3. If no:\\ \tt    - Is the word in Earth sciences? (geology/geography) or human fields (anthropology/sociology). Split into two groups of two each.\\ \tt    - Then further narrow down within those groups.\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps it's better to proceed with a step-by-step approach without overcomplicating.\\ \tt \\ \tt In summary, here's a possible sequence:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the word a language? Yes → italian/german; No → others.\\ \tt 2. For Yes: Is it German?\\ \tt    - If yes → guess german\\ \tt    - If no → guess italian\\ \tt 3. For No: Is the word related to Earth sciences (geology/geography)?\\ \tt    - Yes: Next question, is it "geography"? Then guess accordingly.\\ \tt    - No: Is it in human fields (anthropology/sociology)?\\ \tt      - Yes: Guess between them\\ \tt      - No: Technology/Engineering; ask if "technology", else "engineering"\\ \tt 4. If any step leads to more than two options, adjust questions.\\ \tt \\ \tt This approach uses up to four steps for the non-languages and two steps for languages, totaling six questions before the guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Then, on the seventh question, make the final guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps I need to be more efficient.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of it as a binary search:\\ \tt \\ \tt With eight words, log2(8)=3 questions needed, but since some questions might not perfectly split, maybe four.\\ \tt \\ \tt But I have seven questions allowed, so I can afford to take an extra step if needed.\\ \tt \\ \tt In any case, the initial question is crucial: asking about language is the best first move because it splits the list into two equal groups of four each. From there, proceed accordingly.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, to recap:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is it a language? (4 yes, 4 no)\\ \tt    - Yes → Italian/German\\ \tt    - No → Geol/Geog/Tech/Eng/Antrop/Soci\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. For the Yes group:\\ \tt    - Is it German? If yes, guess; else, italian.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. For the No group:\\ \tt    - Next question: Is it related to Earth sciences (geology/geography)?\\ \tt      - If yes: ask if it's geography → guess\\ \tt      - If no: Then it's among Tech/Eng/Antrop/Soci\\ \tt         - Ask if related to human behavior (Anthrop/Soci)\\ \tt            - Yes: guess between them\\ \tt            - No: guess tech/eng\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. Continue narrowing as needed.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, in total, after three questions for the language group and potentially more for others, I might need up to seven questions.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since I have only one chance to guess, I need to ensure that within seven questions, I can narrow down to the target word.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given that, I think the optimal strategy is:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is it a language? (yes/no)\\ \tt 2. For yes group:\\ \tt    - Starts with vowel → italian; else german.\\ \tt 3. For no group:\\ \tt    - Earth science? If yes: geography or geology\\ \tt        - Next question: is it "geography"?\\ \tt           - Yes → guess, else geology.\\ \tt    - Else (human fields):\\ \tt        - Next question: is it "anthropology"? Else sociology.\\ \tt    - Else (technology/engineering):\\ \tt        - Next question: is it "technology"? Else engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt So this approach uses up to six questions before the last guess. Hence, on the seventh question, I can make the final guess based on previous narrows.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since I need to structure each step as a separate question, here's how it would look:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the word a language?\\ \tt    - Yes\\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Does the word start with a vowel?\\ \tt    - Yes → it's italian\\ \tt 3. GUESS: italian\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but if step 2 is yes, I can guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps if step 1 is no:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the word a language?\\ \tt    - No\\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Is the word related to Earth sciences (geology/geography)?\\ \tt    - Yes\\ \tt 3. QUESTION: Is the word "geography"?\\ \tt    - If yes, guess; else geology.\\ \tt 4. And so on.\\ \tt \\ \tt But I need to design this as a series of questions, not a decision tree.\\ \tt \\ \tt Perhaps an example:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the target word in German or Italian? (since those are languages)\\ \tt    Wait, but no, because other words may also be languages in the list. But in our case, the options are geology, geography, italian, german, etc. So actually, it's about whether it's a language.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, no: 'geology', 'geography' are fields, while 'italian', 'german' are languages. So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the word one of "italian" or "german"? (i.e., is it a language)\\ \tt \\ \tt Yes/No.\\ \tt \\ \tt If Yes → target is italian or german\\ \tt \\ \tt If No → target is among geology/geography, technology/engineering, anthropology/sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. If step 1 Yes:\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. QUESTION: Does the word have four letters? Wait, that's not allowed as they all have same length.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, perhaps better to ask if it starts with a vowel.\\ \tt \\ \tt So:\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. QUESTION: Does the target word start with a vowel letter?\\ \tt \\ \tt Yes/No.\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes → it's "italian"\\ \tt \\ \tt If no → german\\ \tt \\ \tt That way, within two questions, I can guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Similarly, for non-language words.\\ \tt \\ \tt But let me proceed step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt The initial question is crucial: ask if the word is a language. Then, for languages, determine between italian and german. For others, narrow down to Earth sciences or human fields.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here's how the conversation would flow:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the target word one of the languages "italian" or "german"?\\ \tt \\ \tt    (This splits into two groups: language vs non-language)\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. If Yes:\\ \tt    - QUESTION: Does the target word start with a vowel?\\ \tt \\ \tt       a. Yes → it's 'italian'\\ \tt \\ \tt       b. No → it's 'german'\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. If step 1 is No:\\ \tt    - Then it's among geology, geography, technology, engineering, anthropology, sociology.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. Next question for this group: Is the target word one of the Earth sciences: geology or geography?\\ \tt \\ \tt    - Yes → need to narrow down\\ \tt \\ \tt    - No → it's in human fields or tech/engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. Let's assume step 4 is Yes (Earth science):\\ \tt \\ \tt 6. QUESTION: Is the word "geography"?\\ \tt \\ \tt       a. Yes → target is 'geography'\\ \tt \\ \tt       b. No → target is 'geology'\\ \tt \\ \tt 7. GUESS: [target]\\ \tt \\ \tt But if it takes more steps, perhaps I need to adjust.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, in order not to exceed seven questions, let's structure them as:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the word a language? (step 1)\\ \tt 2. If yes, starts with vowel? → guess\\ \tt 3. Else, ask about Earth sciences\\ \tt 4. Depending on step 3, narrow down within that group\\ \tt 5. Then another question to identify within those two\\ \tt 6. Final guess\\ \tt \\ \tt But given seven questions allowed, perhaps:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is the target a language?\\ \tt 2. If yes: starts with vowel? → guess\\ \tt 3. If no: related to Earth? Yes/No\\ \tt 4. If step 3 Yes: is it geography? Yes/No → guess if yes, else geology\\ \tt 5. If step 3 No: human fields? Yes/No\\ \tt 6. If step 5 Yes: is it anthropology? → guess; else sociology\\ \tt 7. If step 5 No: tech or eng? → ask in step 6: is it technology? → guess if yes, else engineering.\\ \tt \\ \tt But this would require up to seven questions before the final guess, and then the eighth for guessing, but only seven are allowed for questions, so I can only ask seven before needing to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hence, perhaps the initial approach of three questions is optimal.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, perhaps a better way:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Is it a language? Yes → target is italian/german\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. If yes:\\ \tt    - QUESTION: Does the word have 'ian' in it?\\ \tt \\ \tt       a. Yes (italian) → guess\\ \tt \\ \tt       b. No (german) → guess\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. If no, step 1:\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. QUESTION: Is the word related to Earth or human?\\ \tt \\ \tt    - Yes/No.\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. If yes:\\ \tt    - Next question: is it 'anthropology' or 'sociology'? Or geol/geog.\\ \tt \\ \tt 6. Final guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt But perhaps not optimal.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, considering all this, I think the best approach is:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the word a language (italian or german)?\\ \tt    Yes\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. If yes:\\ \tt    - QUESTION: Does it start with a vowel? Yes → it's 'italian'\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Else, if step 2 No → target is 'german'\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. If step 1 No:\\ \tt    - Then ask if it's in Earth sciences (geol/geog) or human fields.\\ \tt \\ \tt       i.e., QUESTION: Is the word either geology, geography, anthropology, or sociology?\\ \tt \\ \tt    Yes → proceed\\ \tt \\ \tt    No → tech/eng\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. For Yes group:\\ \tt \\ \tt 6. QUESTION: Is the word 'geography'? Yes → guess; else 'geology'\\ \tt \\ \tt 7. Else, for human fields group:\\ \tt \\ \tt 8. QUESTION: Is the word 'anthropology' or 'sociology'? Split into two.\\ \tt \\ \tt But again, only seven questions allowed before guessing, so perhaps adjust to combine steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt In summary, after careful consideration, here is a sequence of questions that should narrow down the target efficiently within seven queries, ending with the correct guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt \\ \tt Here's the structured approach using a series of yes/no questions and a final guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the target word one of "italian" or "german"?\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. If Yes:\\ \tt    - QUESTION: Does the target word start with a vowel? (i.e., 'i' in "italian")\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. If Yes, GUESS: italian\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. Else, GUESS: german\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. If step 1 is No:\\ \tt    - QUESTION: Is the target word related to Earth sciences (geology/geography) or human fields (anthropology/sociology/technology/engineering)?\\ \tt \\ \tt 6. If Yes (Earth/human):\\ \tt    - Next question for further narrowing down.\\ \tt \\ \tt 7. Based on the responses, make the final guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the process is optimized within seven questions, here's the concise step-by-step with the last question leading to the guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the target word one of "italian" or "german"?\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. If Yes:\\ \tt    - QUESTION: Does it start with a vowel? (Yes → 'italian'; No → 'german')\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Else, proceed with questions about Earth/human fields.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. Final guess based on responses from previous steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, to fit within seven questions, the final guess is made after six questions, as step seven would be the guess itself.\\ \tt \\ \tt Final structured play:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. QUESTION: Is the target word one of "italian" or "german"?\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. QUESTION: If it's a language (yes), does it start with a vowel?\\ \tt \\ \tt    - Yes → GUESS: italian\\ \tt \\ \tt    - No → GUESS: german\\ \tt \\ \tt 3.
