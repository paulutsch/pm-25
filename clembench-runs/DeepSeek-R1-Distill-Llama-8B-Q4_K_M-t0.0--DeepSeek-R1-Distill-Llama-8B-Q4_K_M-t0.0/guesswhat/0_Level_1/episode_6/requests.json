I need to ask questions that will narrow down the possibilities quickly. \n\nFirst, I should consider how each of these words starts with a letter. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Safety - S\n2. End - E\n3. Turnip - T\n4. Eggplant - E\n5. Rattlesnake - R\n6. Rat - R\n7. Rock - R\n8. Desert - D\n\nSo, the starting letters are: S, E, T, E, R, R, R, D.\n\nIf I ask a question about the first letter, maybe that can help me categorize them. For example, \"Is the target word starting with 'S'?\" This would only apply to 'Safety'. If the answer is yes, then that's the word. If no, we can eliminate 'Safety'.\n\nBut if it starts with another letter like E, T, R, or D, I'll have more options. So maybe a better approach is to ask about whether the target word contains certain letters that are unique. Let me see:\n\nLooking at each word:\n\n- Safety: contains 'a', 'f', etc.\n- End: ends with 'd'\n- Turnip: starts and ends with 'T'\n- Eggplant: starts with 'E' and has 'gg'\n- Rattlesnake: starts with 'R' and has 'ttles'\n- Rat: starts with 'R' and ends with 't'\n- Rock: starts with 'R' and ends with 'k'\n- Desert: starts with 'D'\n\nSo, perhaps asking about whether the word contains double letters might help. For example, \"Does the target word contain double letters?\" Looking at the list:\n\n- Safety: no\n- End: no\n- Turnip: 'tt', yes\n- Eggplant: 'gg', yes\n- Rattlesnake: 'ttles', yes\n- Rat: no\n- Rock: no\n- Desert: no\n\nSo, if the answer is yes, it could be Turnip, Eggplant, or Rattlesnake. If not, it's Safety, End, Rat, Rock, or Desert.\n\nWait, but that doesn't narrow it down enough because we still have multiple options left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask about whether the word ends with a specific letter. For example, \"Does the target word end with 'e'?\" Let's check:\n\n- Safety: no\n- End: yes (ends with d)\n- Turnip: no\n- Eggplant: yes? Wait, Eggplant is E-n-d, so no.\nWait, let me correct that. Eggplant is spelled E-g-g-p-l-a-n-t, so it ends with 't', not 'e'. So:\n\n- Safety: ends with 'y' → no\n- End: ends with 'd' → yes (but actually the last letter is 'd')\n- Turnip: ends with 'p' → yes?\nWait, Turnip is T-u-r-n-i-p. The last letter is 'p', so yes.\n\nEggplant: ends with 't' → yes.\nRattlesnake: ends with 'e' → yes (since it's Rattlesnake, the last letter is 'e').\nRat: ends with 't' → yes.\nRock: ends with 'k' → yes.\nDesert: ends with 't' → no.\n\nWait, this might not be helpful because too many words end with letters. Maybe a better approach is to think of unique features.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps asking if the word starts with a vowel or consonant. Let me see:\n\nStarting letters:\n\n- S (consonant)\n- E (vowel)\n- T (consonant)\n- E (vowel)\n- R (consonant)\n- R (consonant)\n- R (consonant)\n- D (consonant)\n\nSo, the words starting with vowels are 'End' and 'Eggplant'. Others start with consonants.\n\nIf I ask: \"Does the target word start with a vowel?\" The answer would be yes only for End or Eggplant. If no, it's one of Safety, Turnip, Rattlesnake, Rat, Rock, Desert.\n\nThat might help narrow it down.\n\nThen, perhaps next question could be about the number of syllables, but I can't ask that since the rules restrict to yes/no questions related only to letters or structure, but not specifics like syllables. Wait, actually, the rules say questions cannot relate to structure or spelling specifics, so maybe not syllables.\n\nAlternatively, think of other unique letter combinations. For example, 'End' is a short word ending with d. 'Safety' has 'a'. Turnip has 'tt', but that's more than one turnip... Wait, no, the actual word is 'Turnip' which does have double t.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach: asking if the target word is longer or shorter. But again, not sure if that's allowed. The rules say questions cannot be about structure or specifics like that. So perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAnother angle: asking about the presence of certain letters that are unique in some words.\n\nFor example, 'Safety' has 'f', which none of the others do. So maybe a question about whether the word contains 'f'. If yes, it's Safety. That could be efficient because only Safety contains 'f'.\n\nSo first question: \"Does the target word contain the letter 'f'?\"\n\nIf yes, then guess Safety.\n\nIf no, move on to other words.\n\nThat seems smart because it eliminates one word quickly.\n\nThen, if the answer is no, we can eliminate Safety and proceed with the remaining words: ['End', 'Turnip', 'Eggplant', 'Rattlesnake', 'Rat', 'Rock', 'Desert'].\n\nNext, maybe ask about whether the word starts with a vowel as before. So:\n\n\"Does the target word start with a vowel?\"\n\nIf yes, then it's either End or Eggplant.\n\nIf no, it's one of Turnip, Rattlesnake, Rat, Rock, Desert.\n\nThen, perhaps ask about whether the word contains 'tt' for Turnip, but that might not be efficient because other words have 't's too. Alternatively, asking if the word ends with a specific letter.\n\nAlternatively, since End and Eggplant are both starting with E, I can think of another unique feature. For example, 'End' is 3 letters, while 'Eggplant' is longer. But again, not sure if I can ask about length.\n\nWait, perhaps I can't. The rules say questions must be yes/no without relating to structure specifics.\n\nAlternatively, think of 'Rattlesnake' which has 'snakes'. Maybe a question like \"Does the word contain the letters 's' and 'k'?\" Because Rock is the only one with 'k'.\n\nWait, checking:\n\n- Safety: s\n- End: no s except maybe 'd'\n- Turnip: t, u, r, n, i, p → no 's' or 'k'\n- Eggplant: e, g, p, l, a, n, t → no s or k\n- Rattlesnake: r, a, t, t, l, e, s, n, a, k, e → yes, has both s and k.\n- Rat: r, a, t → no s or k\n- Rock: r, o, c, k → yes, has 'k'\n- Desert: d, e, s, e, r, t → has 's' but not 'k'\n\nSo if I ask, \"Does the target word contain both 's' and 'k'?\" The answer would be yes only for Rattlesnake. Because Rock only has 'k', not 's', and others either don't have s or k.\n\nSo that could help narrow down to Rattlesnake if the answer is yes, but also Rock is possible because it has 'k', but doesn't have 's'.\n\nWait, no: the question is about both 's' and 'k'. So only Rattlesnake has both. Rock has 'k' but not 's'. Therefore, if the target word contains both, it's Rattlesnake.\n\nThat could be a useful second question.\n\nSo sequence:\n\n1. Does the target contain 'f'? (Yes/No) → Safety is eliminated if yes.\n\n2. If no to 1, ask if it contains both 's' and 'k'. (Yes → Rattlesnake; No → not.)\n\nWait, but let's see: after question 1, we have ['End', 'Turnip', 'Eggplant', 'Rattlesnake', 'Rat', 'Rock', 'Desert'].\n\nQuestion 2: Does it contain both 's' and 'k'? Only Rattlesnake has both. So if answer is yes, target is Rattlesnake. If no, move on.\n\nIf question 1 is no (so not Safety) and question 2 is yes → guess Rattlesnake.\n\nIf question 2 is no, then eliminate Rattlesnake and Rock because only Rattlesnake has both s and k. So remaining words: ['End', 'Turnip', 'Eggplant', 'Rat', 'Desert'].\n\nThen, perhaps ask if the word starts with a vowel again. So:\n\n3. Does the target start with a vowel? (Yes → End or Eggplant; No → Turnip, Rat, Desert.)\n\nIf yes, then we have two options: End or Eggplant.\n\nNow, to differentiate between them, need another question. Maybe about whether it contains 'gg' for Eggplant. So:\n\n4. Does the target contain double 'g's? (Yes → Eggplant; No → End.)\n\nEggplant has 'gg', so if yes, guess Eggplant. If no, guess End.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. Contains 'f'? (Y/N)\n   - Y → Safety\n   - N → proceed\n\n2. Contains both 's' and 'k'? (Y/N)\n   - Y → Rattlesnake\n   - N → proceed\n\n3. Starts with vowel? (Y/N)\n   - Y → End/Eggplant\n   - N → Turnip/Rat/Desert\n\n4. If step 3 is yes, then:\n   a. Contains 'gg'? Y → Eggplant; N → End.\n\n5. If step 3 is no, need another approach for the remaining words: Turnip, Rat, Desert.\n\nWait, in that case, perhaps after step 2 if it's no (so not Rattlesnake or Rock), and step 3 is no (not End or Eggplant), then we have Turnip, Rat, Desert left. How to differentiate them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should adjust the questions to be more efficient.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Since after question 1 and 2, if we're in a situation where we have multiple words left, perhaps using other unique features.\n\nWait, let's outline the possible branches:\n\nAfter question 1 (contains 'f') → Safety or others.\n\nIf not Safety, proceed to question 2 about 's' and 'k'. If yes → Rattlesnake. If no → remaining: End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat, Rock, Desert.\n\nThen, for those, perhaps ask if it contains 'tt' (for Turnip) or starts with 'E'.\n\nSo:\n\n3. Does the target contain double 't's? Y → Turnip; N → others.\n\nIf yes, guess Turnip.\n\nIf no, then among End, Eggplant, Rat, Rock, Desert, need to proceed.\n\nWait, but in that case, I might have to ask more questions than allowed. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after question 3 (starting with vowel), if it's yes, then we can ask about 'gg' as before.\n\nBut let me think of another way: For the remaining words after question 2 is no, which are End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat, Rock, Desert, maybe I can find a common feature to eliminate some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of starting with 'f', I could start with other letters.\n\nWait, but 'f' is only in Safety. So that's efficient because it quickly identifies it if yes. If not, then move on.\n\nThen, after that, the next question about 's' and 'k' is useful to eliminate Rattlesnake if present.\n\nSo perhaps the sequence is:\n\n1. Contains 'f'? (Y → Safety)\n2. Contains both 's' and 'k'? (Y → Rattlesnake; else proceed)\n3. Starts with a vowel? (Y → End or Eggplant; N → Turnip, Rat, Desert, Rock)\n\nWait, but after question 1: if no, then Safety is out.\n\nQuestion 2: about s and k. If yes → Rattlesnake. So that's two questions to possibly identify the target.\n\nIf not, proceed.\n\nThen, question 3: starts with vowel? Y → End or Eggplant.\n\nSo for four words (End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat, Rock, Desert) left after question 2 is no.\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nAfter question 1: if 'f' is not present, then we have ['End', 'Turnip', 'Eggplant', 'Rattlesnake', 'Rat', 'Rock', 'Desert'].\n\nQuestion 2: Does it contain both 's' and 'k'? Y → Rattlesnake; N → ['End', 'Turnip', 'Eggplant', 'Rat', 'Rock', 'Desert'].\n\nSo, if question 2 is yes → target is Rattlesnake. So that's two questions to find it.\n\nIf no, proceed with:\n\nQuestion 3: Starts with vowel? Y → End or Eggplant; N → Turnip, Rat, Rock, Desert.\n\nSo after three questions, we might have narrowed down.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making mistakes. For example, Rattlesnake starts with 'R' and has both 's' and 'k', so that's correct.\n\nIf the answer to question 2 is no, then we eliminate Rattlesnake and Rock (because Rock has 'k' but not 's').\n\nWait, actually, if the answer to question 2 is no, it means the word doesn't contain both 's' and 'k'. So it could be any of End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat, or Desert. Because Rattlesnake and Rock would have been yes if they had both, but since question 2 is about both, a no answer eliminates both Rattlesnake and Rock.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let's think: Rattlesnake has 's' and 'k', so if the word doesn't contain both, it can't be Rattlesnake or Rock (since Rock only has 'k'). So yes, after question 2 being no, we can eliminate both.\n\nTherefore, remaining words after questions 1 and 2 are ['End', 'Turnip', 'Eggplant', 'Rat', 'Desert'].\n\nThen, question 3: does it start with a vowel? Yes → End or Eggplant. No → Turnip, Rat, Desert.\n\nIf yes (step 3), then proceed to step 4: Does it contain 'gg'? Y → Eggplant; N → End.\n\nIf no (step 3 is no), then the target is either Turnip, Rat, or Desert.\n\nFor those, perhaps a question about whether they have 't's. But I need to think of a yes/no question that can help differentiate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach: 'Desert' starts with 'D', which is unique among the remaining words (End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat) start with E, T, E, R respectively. Wait, but after step 3, if it's no, the starting letters are:\n\n- Turnip: T\n- Rat: R\n- Desert: D\n\nSo perhaps question 4: Does the word start with a vowel or consonant? But wait, we already did that in step 3.\n\nAlternatively, ask about whether the word contains 'd'. Let's see:\n\nEnd: ends with d → yes.\nTurnip: no.\nEggplant: no.\nRat: no.\nDesert: has 'd' → yes.\n\nSo question 4: Does the target contain 'd'? Y → End or Desert; N → Turnip or Rat.\n\nIf yes, then it's either End or Desert. If no, it's Turnip or Rat.\n\nThen, to differentiate between End and Desert:\n\nQuestion 5: Is the word longer than four letters? Let's see.\n\nEnd: 3 letters.\nDesert: 6 letters.\nSo if I can ask about length, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. The rules say questions cannot be related to structure or specifics like that, so perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, think of another unique feature. For example:\n\nQuestion 5: Does the word end with 'd' or 't'? Let me check.\n\nEnd ends with 'd', Desert ends with 't'.\n\nSo question: \"Does the target word end with 'd'?\" → Yes for End; No for Desert and others.\n\nBut wait, if after step 4, we have End or Desert (because they contain 'd'), then:\n\nIf step 5 is yes → End. If no, it's Desert.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of a question that only applies to one word. For example, \"Does the target contain the letter 'p'?\" Let's see:\n\nEnd: no.\nDesert: no.\nTurnip: yes.\nRat: no.\nSo if I ask about 'p', and answer is yes → Turnip; if no → End or Desert.\n\nBut that might not be precise because Desert doesn't have p but does have d. Wait, question 4 already asked about 'd'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nQuestion 5: Is the word 'Turnip'? (Y/N) But that's just guessing, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, I need to stick to yes/no questions based on general characteristics.\n\nAnother approach: After step 4 has narrowed down to End or Desert:\n\nQuestion 5: Does the word contain 'e'? Both do. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, \"Does the word start with 'D'?\" → Yes for Desert; No for End.\n\nSo if I ask that, and get a yes → Desert. If no → End.\n\nThus, in total, the questions would be:\n\n1. Contains 'f'? Y/N\n2. Contains both 's' and 'k'? Y/N\n3. Starts with vowel? Y/N\n4. Contains 'd'? Y/N (after step 3 is yes)\n5. Starts with 'D'? Y/N\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in fewer questions.\n\nWait, maybe after step 3 (starts with vowel), and knowing that the target is either End or Eggplant:\n\nQuestion 4: Does the word end with 't'? Let's check:\n\nEnd ends with d. So answer would be no.\nEggplant ends with t (as in planted). Wait, eggplant ends with 't' in the plural, but in singular it's 'eggplant', which doesn't necessarily end with t? Wait, actually, 'Eggplant' is a plant, and its singular form is 'Eggplant', which does not end with t. So perhaps that question isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nQuestion 4: Does the word start with 'E'? → Y for Eggplant; N for End.\n\nSo if yes → Eggplant; no → End.\n\nThus, that would be step 4.\n\nSo overall sequence:\n\n1. Contains 'f'?\n2. Contains both 's' and 'k'?\n3. Starts with vowel?\n4. Starts with 'E'?\n\nIf after step 3 is yes, then step 4: starts with E → Eggplant; else, End.\n\nThus, in this case, maximum questions needed would be 4, but depending on the path, maybe fewer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose target is Safety: question1= Y, so done in 1.\nIf not, question2: contains s and k? For Rattlesnake → Y. So total 2.\nFor End: question3=Y, then question4: starts with E → yes (Eggplant), but wait, no, target is End.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me outline all possibilities:\n\n1. If the word is Safety:\n   - Q1: Y\n   - So identified in 1.\n\n2. If not Safety:\n   a. Check if contains s and k (Rattlesnake):\n      - Q2: Rattlesnake → Y\n      - Identified in 2.\n   \n   b. Else, not Rattlesnake or Rock:\n      i. Check if starts with vowel (End/Eggplant)\n         - Q3: yes → proceed\n         - If Q3 yes:\n             * Q4: starts with E? Y → Eggplant; N → End.\n           So total 4 questions for this path.\n\n      ii. Else, not End or Eggplant:\n          - Need to check among Turnip, Rat, Desert\n           But how? Maybe through other features, but that would require more questions.\n\nWait, but perhaps after Q3 is no (not starting with vowel), then the word must be Turnip, Rat, or Desert. To differentiate:\n\nQuestion4: Does it contain 't'? Y → Turnip; N → Rat/Desert.\nIf Y → Turnip\nIf N → Then, between Rat and Desert:\n   Question5: Does it start with D? Y → Desert; N → Rat.\n\nBut that's 5 questions. But the user said maximum of 7 questions allowed. So perhaps not a problem, but trying to minimize is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a smarter way to reduce the number of questions.\n\nWait, perhaps after step3 (starts with vowel) is yes:\n\nQuestion4: Does it contain 'gg'? Y → Eggplant; N → End.\n\nThus, in this case, if step3 is yes and step4 is no, then it's End.\n\nThus, for End, total questions would be Q1:N, Q2:N, Q3:Y, Q4:N → 4 questions.\n\nIf the target is Turnip:\n\nQ1:N, Q2:N, Q3:N (since starts with T, not vowel), so need another approach.\n\nQuestion4: contains 't'? Y → Turnip; N → others.\n\nSo, total 4.\n\nSimilarly for Rat:\nQ1:N, Q2:N, Q3:N (starts with R), Q4:N (doesn't contain 'd'), then need to differentiate between Rat and Desert:\n\nWait, if after Q4:N (does not contain 'd'), then it's either Rat or Turnip (since Turnip also doesn't contain 'd').\n\nSo perhaps question5: Does the word start with R? Y → Rat; N → Turnip.\n\nThus, total 5 questions for Rat and Turnip.\n\nBut that might be too many.\n\nAlternatively, think of another feature. For example:\n\nAfter step3:N, which leaves us with Turnip, Rat, Desert:\n\nQuestion4: contains 's'? Let me see:\n- Turnip: no\n- Rat: no\n- Desert: yes (as in sand)\n\nSo if Q4: Y → Desert; N → Turnip/Rat.\n\nThen, need to differentiate between them:\n\nIf Q4:N, then either Turnip or Rat.\n\nQuestion5: Does it start with R? Y → Rat; N → Turnip.\n\nThus, total 6 questions for this case.\n\nBut since the user allows up to 7, perhaps acceptable.\n\nBut I think there's a smarter way. Maybe after step3 is no, and we have Turnip, Rat, Desert:\n\nQuestion4: Does it end with 't'? Y → Turnip; N → others.\n\nWait, Turnip ends with 'p', so answer would be no. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nQuestion4: Does the word contain two syllables? Let me see:\n- End: one\n- Eggplant: two (but if we're in this path, we've passed that)\n- Turnip: one\n- Rat: one\n- Desert: two\n\nWait, but in the case where step3:N is reached, meaning starts with consonant: Turnip (T), Rat (R), Desert (D). All have one syllable? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see:\n\nThe target must be among these words. To minimize questions, perhaps prioritize the ones that can be identified quickly.\n\nThus, the sequence could be:\n\n1. Does it contain 'f'? (Safety)\n2. Contains both 's' and 'k'? (Rattlesnake)\n3. Starts with a vowel? (End or Eggplant)\n4. Contains 'gg'? (Eggplant)\n5. If step3 yes: then step4 answer determines.\n   - If no to step4, it's End.\n\n6. Else, if step3 no:\n   a. Does it contain 'd'? (End or Desert)\n      - Q6: contains 'd'? Y → End/Desert; N → Turnip/Rat\n      b. If Q6 yes:\n          i. Starts with D? → Desert; else End.\n     c. If Q6 no:\n         i. Contains 't' ? (Y → Turnip; N → Rat)\n\nThus, this would take up to 7 questions in the worst case.\n\nBut I think we can do better by rearranging the order of questions.\n\nAlternatively, let's try a different approach focusing on yes/no that can narrow down the list quickly:\n\nStart with:\n\n1. Does it contain 's'? Let's see:\n   - Safety: Y\n   - Rattlesnake: Y\n   - End: N\n   - Turnip: N\n   - Eggplant: N\n   - Rat: N\n   - Rock: Y (has 's')\n   - Desert: N\n\nSo question1: Contains 's'? If Y → Safety, Rattlesnake, Rock.\nIf N → End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat, Desert.\n\nThat might not be efficient because it leaves multiple options if yes. So perhaps better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal sequence is:\n\n1. Contains 'f'?\n2. Contains both 's' and 'k'?\n3. Starts with vowel?\n4. If starts with vowel: contains 'gg'? Y → Eggplant; N → End.\n5. Else (starts with consonant):\n   a. Does it contain 't'? Y → Turnip; N → others.\n   b. For the others, determine based on other features.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, after 4 questions, we can cover most cases.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to outline all possibilities step-by-step.\n\nLet me create a decision tree.\n\nDecision Tree:\n\nStart with Question1: Contains 'f'?\n- If Y: Safety (Q1)\n- Else:\n   Proceed.\n\nQuestion2: Does it contain both 's' and 'k'? (Rattlesnake)\n- If Y: Rattlesnake (Q2)\n- Else:\n   Not Rattlesnake or Rock, so among End, Turnip, Eggplant, Rat, Desert.\n\nQuestion3: Starts with vowel? (End, Eggplant)\n- If Y: Proceed to Q4.\n- Else: Among Turnip, Rat, Desert.\n\nIf Question3 is Y:\n- Question4: Contains 'gg'?
