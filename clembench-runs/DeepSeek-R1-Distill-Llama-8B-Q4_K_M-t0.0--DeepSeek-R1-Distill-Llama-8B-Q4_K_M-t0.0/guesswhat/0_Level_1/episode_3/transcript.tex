	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Jade', 'Sapphire', 'Cruise', 'Yacht', 'Clothes', 'Grass', 'Opossum', 'Mouse']

	 To narrow down the target word efficiently within 7 questions, follow this structured approach:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Question 1:** Is the word related to clothing?\\ \tt    - If yes, guess "Clothes."\\ \tt    - If no, continue.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Question 2:** Is the word either "Jade" or "Sapphire"?\\ \tt    - If yes, make an educated guess between the two.\\ \tt    - If no, proceed.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Question 3:** Does the word relate to water transportation (e.g., Cruise or Yacht)?\\ \tt    - If yes, make a guess between them.\\ \tt    - If no, continue.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Question 4:** Is the word an animal (either Opossum or Mouse)?\\ \tt    - If yes, guess either "Opossum" or "Mouse."\\ \tt    - If no, conclude it's "Grass."\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. **Final Guess:** If all previous questions resulted in "No," guess "Grass."\\ \tt \\ \tt This strategy ensures each question effectively narrows down the possibilities, leading to an optimal guess within the allowed number of queries.\\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>
