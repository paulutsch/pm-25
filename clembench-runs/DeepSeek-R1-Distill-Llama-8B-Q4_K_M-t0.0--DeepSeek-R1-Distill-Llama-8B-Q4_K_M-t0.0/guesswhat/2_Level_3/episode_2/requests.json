Let me start by thinking about the characteristics of each word.\n\nFirst, I can list them all: Apple, Cedar, Lemon, Orange, Peach, Pear, Plum, Pine. That's eight words. The goal is to narrow this down as quickly as possible with yes/no questions without giving away any structure or specific characteristics.\n\nI remember that one effective way in guessing games is to group the words based on their first letters. Let me see: A, C, L, O, P, P, P, P. So we have four P's and then Apple (A), Cedar (C), Lemon (L), Orange (O). Maybe I can start by asking about the number of P's or something related to the letters.\n\nWait, but the questions need to be yes/no and can't relate to structure or spelling directly. So perhaps a question like \"Is the target word among the ones starting with A, C, L, O?\" But that might not be specific enough. Alternatively, maybe I can ask about how many of them start with a particular letter.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the actual words and their possible associations. For example, Pear and Apple are both fruits but have different uses—Apple is often associated with desserts or technology companies, while Pear is more commonly used as fruit. But since the question needs to be yes/no without hinting towards specific characteristics, that might not work.\n\nWait, perhaps I can ask about the presence of certain letters. For example, \"Is the word 'Peach' in the list?\" But no, because each turn is a question, and I don't want to reveal if it's one of the options until the end.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I can categorize them based on something else, like whether they are trees or fruits. But since all these words refer to either fruits or trees, that might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, I could try grouping by syllables. Pear (1), Apple (2?), no, Apple is two syllables—'A-p-ple'. Similarly, Peach is also two syllables. Wait, but the user didn't specify structure, so maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a question that splits them into groups where one group has the target and others don't. For example, asking if the word starts with 'P'—if yes, then it's either Pear, Plum, Peach, or Pine. If not, it's among Apple, Cedar, Lemon, or Orange.\n\nThat might be a good first step. So I can ask: \"Does the target word start with the letter P?\" \n\nIf the answer is yes, I narrow down to Pear, Plum, Peach, or Pine. If no, then it's among Apple, Cedar, Lemon, or Orange.\n\nThen in the next question, I can further narrow it down. For instance, if the first answer was yes (P group), ask: \"Does the target word end with 'r'?\" But wait, Pear ends with 'r', Plum ends with 'm', Peach with 'ch', Pine with 'e'. So that might not be as helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better question for the P group would be about whether it's related to a fruit typically found in orchards—Pear is, while others like Plum and Pine are also fruits but perhaps less directly. Hmm, but again, I can't reference specifics.\n\nWait, another idea: Ask if the word starts with two letters that appear only once or something. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the P group:\n- Pear (starts with P)\n- Plum (P)\n- Peach (P)\n- Pine (P)\n\nSo all start with P. So perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWhat about asking if the word is \"Pear\"? No, that's too direct and I can only ask yes/no without giving hints.\n\nWait, maybe the first question could be: \"Is the target word in the list of fruits that have 'ear' in their name?\" Pear has 'ear', so if it's yes, then Pear; but since I can't specify, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, think about whether they are common names or scientific names. But again, not helpful.\n\nWait, let me try to categorize based on the presence of certain letters. For example: \"Does the target word contain the letter 'e'?\" Let's see:\n\n- Pear: yes\n- Apple: yes\n- Plum: yes (u and m)\n- Peach: yes\n- Lemon: yes\n- Orange: yes\n- Pine: yes\n- Cedar: yes\n\nSo that doesn't help because all have 'e'.\n\nAnother angle: \"Does the target word contain the letter 'a'?\" Let's check:\n\n- Pear: no\n- Apple: yes (has a)\n- Plum: no (p,l,u,m)\nWait, wait: Wait, Plum is P-L-U-M—does it have an 'a'? No. So Pear (no), Apple (yes), Plum (no), Peach (has 'a'?), wait 'peach' has two 'e's but not 'a'. So:\n\n- Pear: no\n- Apple: yes\n- Plum: no\n- Peach: no\n- Lemon: no\n- Orange: no\n- Pine: no\n- Cedar: yes (C-E-D-A-R)\n\nSo if I ask if the word contains an 'a', then possible targets are Apple or Cedar.\n\nSimilarly, asking about containing an 'r': Pear has 'ear', so that's r; others: Lemon has 'm' and 'n' maybe? Let me check:\n\n- Lemon: l-e-m-o-n\n- Orange: o-r-a-n-g-e\nWait, Orange contains 'r'? No, it's O-R-A-N-G-E—so yes, it does have an 'r'. So if I ask about 'r', possible targets are Pear and Orange.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me think of a better way.\n\nPerhaps the first question should be about whether it starts with P, as that would split them into two groups: 4 P's and the rest (Apple, Cedar, Lemon, Orange).\n\nSo first question: \"Does the target word start with the letter P?\"\n\nIf yes: then from Pear, Plum, Peach, Pine.\n\nIf no: then Apple, Cedar, Lemon, Orange.\n\nThen in the second question, I can ask about whether it's among the ones starting with 'A', 'C', 'L', or 'O'. But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe a better question is to see if it ends with 'e'—but let's check:\n\nPear: ends with 'r'\nApple: ends with 'le'\nPlum: ends with 'm'\nPeach: ends with 'ch'\nPine: ends with 'e'\n\nSo Pine ends with 'e'. So if I ask, \"Does the target word end with the letter e?\" Then Pine is the only one that does. But wait:\n\nWait, no. Let me check all:\n\n- Pear: r\n- Apple: le\n- Plum: um\n- Peach: ch\n- Lemon: on\n- Orange: ge\n- Pine: e\n\nSo Pine ends with 'e', others don't.\n\nSo if I ask that question in the second turn for those who said yes to starting with P, then maybe it's Pine. But perhaps not necessary because other questions can split better.\n\nAlternatively, for the P group (Pear, Plum, Peach, Pine), perhaps I can ask: \"Does the word have a silent 'p'?\" But that relates to structure, which is against the rules.\n\nHmm. Let me try another approach. Maybe think about the words in terms of their meanings:\n\nApple and Orange are fruits commonly eaten as snacks.\nPeach is also a fruit.\nLemon is citrus fruit used for juice or cooking.\nCedar is a type of wood.\nPear is a fruit.\nPlum is a fruit.\n\nSo if I could ask, \"Is the target fruit typically eaten raw?\" But that might hint too much.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a question about whether it's a tree. But all except Apple, Pear, Plum, Peach, Lemon, and Orange are trees? Wait no: Cedar is definitely a type of wood from a cedar tree, but not sure if the others are trees or fruits.\n\nWait, actually:\n\n- Apple: fruit\n- Cedar: tree (used for wood)\n- Lemon: fruit\n- Orange: fruit\n- Peach: fruit\n- Pear: fruit\n- Plum: fruit\n- Pine: tree\n\nSo among these words, Cedar and Pine refer to types of trees. So perhaps a question like \"Is the target word referring to a type of tree?\" If yes, it's Cedar or Pine; if no, then among fruits.\n\nThat could be useful because it splits them into two groups: trees (Cedar, Pine) and fruits (others).\n\nSo first question: \"Is the target word referring to a type of tree?\"\n\nIf yes, then target is Cedar or Pine.\n\nIf no, then target is Apple, Lemon, Orange, Peach, or Pear.\n\nThat's a good split because it reduces the list in half each time.\n\nSo step one:\n\nQuestion: Does the target word refer to a type of tree?\n\nPossible answers:\nYes → Cedar or Pine\nNo → Apple, Lemon, Orange, Peach, Pear, Plum\n\nThen, depending on the answer, proceed differently.\n\nLet me think about both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Answer is Yes (Cedar, Pine)\n\nNow I have two options. Next question needs to narrow down between these two.\n\nWhat's a good yes/no question here? Maybe related to their common uses or characteristics. For example, \"Does the word contain the letter 'a'?\" \n\nLooking:\n\n- Cedar: C-E-D-A-R → has 'a'\n- Pine: P-I-N-E → does not have 'a'\n\nSo if I ask that, and answer is no, then it's Pine. If yes, then Cedar.\n\nThat works because only Cedar contains 'a'.\n\nSo second question in this case: \"Does the target word contain the letter 'a'?\"\n\nIf yes → Cedar\n\nIf no → Pine\n\nThen the third question would be to guess.\n\nCase 2: Answer is No (Apple, Lemon, Orange, Peach, Pear, Plum)\n\nNow we have six options. Let me think about how to split them.\n\nMaybe group them based on fruits that are citrus vs others:\n\nCitrus: Lemon, Orange\n\nNon-citrus: Apple, Peach, Pear, Plum\n\nSo perhaps I can ask if the word refers to a citrus fruit.\n\nQuestion: \"Is the target word referring to a citrus fruit?\"\n\nIf yes → Lemon or Orange\n\nIf no → Apple, Peach, Pear, Plum\n\nThat's a good split because now it's either two options or four.\n\nThen in each subcase:\n\nIf citrus (Lemon/Orange):\n\nNext question could be about whether it's 'Lemon' or 'Orange', but that's too direct. Alternatively, ask if the word has an 'e' at the end: Lemon ends with 'on', Orange with 'nge'. So maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think about their fruit characteristics.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: \"Does the target word start with a vowel?\"\n\nLet me check:\n\n- Apple: A → yes\n- Lemon: L → no\n- Orange: O → yes\n- Peach: P → no\n- Pear: P → no\n- Plum: P → no\n\nSo if I ask if it starts with a vowel, the target could be Apple or Orange.\n\nWait, that might help in splitting.\n\nBut wait, in this case, after the first question, we have six options, and four of them start with A, L, O, P (Apple, Lemon, Orange, Peach). So perhaps not directly useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can ask about the number of syllables or something else.\n\nWait, let me think again. After the first answer is No, we're dealing with Apple, Lemon, Orange, Peach, Pear, Plum.\n\nPerhaps a better question is: \"Does the target word have 'peel' in it?\" \n\nCheck:\n\n- Apple: has 'apple', which can be peeled.\n- Lemon: yes (peel)\n- Orange: yes\n- Peach: no (peach isn't typically peeled as such)\nWait, but actually, you do peel peach fruits. So that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, think about whether the word ends with a specific letter.\n\nFor example, \"Does the target word end with 'le'?\" \n\nCheck:\n\n- Apple: yes\n- Lemon: no (ends with on)\n- Orange: no (ends with ge)\n- Peach: no\n- Pear: no\n- Plum: no\n\nSo if I ask that, only Apple ends with 'le'. So if the answer is yes, then Apple. If not, it's among Lemon, Orange, Peach, Pear, Plum.\n\nBut maybe better to ask about starting with a specific letter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of another approach.\n\nLet me consider that after splitting into trees and fruits:\n\nIf the first question says No, so fruits: A, L, O, P, Pe, Pl.\n\nPerhaps I can ask if it's among those that have a hard fruit texture when ripe. That is, not giving any hints about their structure, but just a yes/no based on common knowledge.\n\nBut the user said questions cannot be related to structure, so perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, think of letters in their names: Maybe \"Does the word contain the letter 'm'?\"\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- Apple: no\n- Lemon: no (l-e-m-o-n? Yes, it does have m)\nWait: Lemon is l-e-m-o-n. So yes, has an 'm'\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Apple: no\n- Lemon: yes\n- Orange: no\n- Peach: no\n- Pear: no\n- Plum: yes (p-l-u-m)\n- Wait, Plum: p-l-u-m. So yes, it has 'm'\n\nSo if I ask \"Does the target word contain the letter 'm'?\" The ones that do are Lemon and Plum.\n\nThus, the question would be:\n\n\"Is the target word among Lemon or Plum?\"\n\nIf yes → Lemon/Plum\n\nIf no → Apple, Orange, Peach, Pear (but wait, Lemon and Plum have m's)\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me check again:\n\n- Apple: no\n- Lemon: yes (has m)\n- Orange: no\n- Peach: no\n- Pear: no\n- Plum: yes (has m)\n\nSo in the list after first answer, we have A, L, O, Pe, P, Pl.\n\nIf I ask if it contains 'm', then L and Pl (Lemon and Plum) would be yes. So:\n\nQuestion: Does the target word contain the letter 'm'?\n\nIf yes → Lemon or Plum\n\nIf no → Apple, Orange, Peach, Pear\n\nThat's a good split because it separates two possible words from four.\n\nThen for each subcase:\n\nCase 1: Target is Lemon or Plum\n\nNext question could be about their endings. For example, \"Does the target word end with 'on'?\"\n\nLemon ends with 'on', Plum doesn't (ends with 'um').\n\nSo if yes → Lemon; if no → Plum.\n\nAlternatively, ask if they're fruits that are often used in desserts, but that might give a hint.\n\nBut since it's yes/no, perhaps better to just proceed.\n\nThus:\n\nQuestion: Does the target word end with 'on'?\n\nIf yes → Lemon\n\nIf no → Plum\n\nCase 2: Target is Apple, Orange, Peach, Pear.\n\nNow, I need to split these four into two groups. Maybe by asking if they start with a certain letter.\n\nFor example, \"Does the target word start with 'O'?\" \n\nCheck:\n\n- Apple: A → no\n- Orange: O → yes\n\nSo if answer is yes, then Orange; else, it's among Apple, Peach, Pear.\n\nBut let me think of another way. Maybe grouping by whether they have two syllables or not.\n\nWait, all four are two-syllable words except maybe Pear—no, Pear is two: Pe-ar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Does the target word have a silent 'p'?\" But that's structure.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Ask if the word contains an 'a'.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Apple: yes\n- Orange: no (o-r-a-n-g-e → yes, it does have 'a')\nWait, wait: Orange is O-R-A-N-G-E. So it has an 'a'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Apple: yes\n- Peach: P-E-A-Ch → yes\n- Pear: no\nWait, but in this case, after first split, the target is among Apple, Orange, Peach, Pear.\n\nSo asking about 'a':\n\nQuestion: \"Does the target word contain the letter 'a'?\"\n\nCheck:\n\n- Apple: yes\n- Orange: yes (has a)\n- Peach: yes\n- Pear: no\n\nSo if yes → Apple or Orange or Peach; if no → Pear.\n\nBut that might not narrow it down enough. Alternatively, perhaps better to ask about whether they are citrus fruits.\n\nQuestion: \"Is the target fruit a citrus fruit?\"\n\nCheck:\n\n- Apple: no\n- Orange: yes\n- Peach: no\n- Pear: no\n\nSo if yes → Orange; if no → among Apple, Peach, Pear (but in our list after split, we have A, O, Pe, P).\n\nWait, but that might not be the best.\n\nAlternatively, think about their common uses. For example, \"Is the target used for juice?\" But again, that's giving a hint.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through possible questions. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. First question: Is the target referring to a type of tree? (Cedar or Pine)\n   - Yes → Cedar/Pine\n   - No → Fruit group\n\n2. If first answer is Yes (Cedar/Pine):\n   a. Second question: Does the word contain the letter 'a'? \n      i. Yes → Cedar\n      ii. No → Pine\n\n3. If first answer is No (Fruit group: A, L, O, Pe, P, Pl):\n   a. Second question: Does the target contain the letter 'm'?\n      i. Yes → Lemon/Plum\n      ii. No → Apple/O, Peach/Pear\n\n4. For cases in 3i:\n   a. Third question (if needed): Ends with 'on'? \n      i. Yes → Lemon\n      ii. No → Plum\n\n5. For cases in 3ii (Apple, O, Pe, P):\n   a. Need to split further. Maybe ask about starting letter.\n      i. Question: Does the target start with 'A'?\n         A) Yes → Apple\n         B) No → among O, Pe, P (Orange, Peach, Pear)\n   \n6. For 5B:\n   a. Next question: Is it a fruit that starts with 'O'? \n      i. Yes → Orange\n      ii. No → Peach/Pear\n\n7. Finally, if still in Peach/Pear, last question could be about something like ending letters, but perhaps at this point, I can make a guess.\n\nWait, but I need to structure it so that I can do it within 7 questions, potentially with fewer steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more streamlined approach is needed. Let me think differently.\n\nAfter the first question:\n\nIf Yes → Cedar or Pine (2 options)\n   Ask: Does it have 'a' → done in two more questions.\n\nTotal: 3 questions to identify between Cedar and Pine.\n\nIf No → Fruit group (6 options). Need to split into smaller groups.\n\nSecond question: Is it among Lemon, Plum? (using m)\n\nYes → 2 options\nNo → 4 options\n\nSo for the Fruit group:\n\nIf contains 'm' → 2 options, else 4.\n\nThen, if 2 options:\n\nQuestion about ending letters, like 'on', to split into two.\n\nTotal: 3 questions.\n\nIf 4 options, need another question to split into 2 each.\n\nFor example, in the remaining 4 (A, O, Pe, P):\n\nAsk if it's among A and O → which is yes or no.\n\nWait:\n\nQuestion: Is the target word starting with a vowel? (A, O)\n\nA) Yes → Apple/O\nB) No → Peach/Pear\n\nThen for each subcase:\n\nIf A) → need another question to split between A and O. Maybe ask if it's Apple or Orange.\n\nBut that could be the fourth question.\n\nAlternatively, make an educated guess after 3 questions.\n\nWait, but I can't because I only have one opportunity to guess. So perhaps in some cases, I can structure it so that with each answer, the possibilities reduce enough.\n\nLet me try structuring it as such:\n\nFirst Question: Is target a tree? (C/P)\n   Yes → Q2: 'a' → Cedar or Pine\n      Then Guess: Cedar/Pine\n\nNo → Fruit group. Second question: Does it have 'm'? (L/Pl)\n\n   If yes:\n      Third question: Ends with 'on'? → Lemon if yes, else Plum.\n      Guess accordingly.\n\n   If no:\n      Fourth question: Starts with 'A' → Apple? Else, among O, Pe, P\n         If starts with A → Guess Apple\n         Else:\n             Fifth question: Starts with O → Orange. Else, Peach/Pear\n                 If yes → Guess Orange\n                 Else → Maybe ask if it's a fruit starting with P → then guess Peach or Pear\n\nWait, but that might take too many questions.\n\nAlternatively, in the Fruit group after first two splits:\n\nIf contains 'm' → 2 options (L/Pl), else 4 options (A, O, Pe, P)\n\nFor the 2 options: L/Pl. Can be split into L/P with another question, say, ends with 'on'. Then guess.\n\nFor the 4 options: A, O, Pe, P\n\nSecond question in this case could be about starting letter:\n\nQuestion: Does the target word start with 'P'? → Yes→Peach/Pear; No→A/O\n\nIf starts with P:\n   Third question: Does it start with 'Pe' → Yes→Peach\n   Else → Pear (if yes, but that's two questions already)\n\nWait, not sure. Let me try to outline the process again.\n\nAlternatively, here is a possible flow:\n\n1. Q1: Is target tree? Y→C/P; N→Fruits\n2. If Y:\n   Q2: Contain 'a'? Y→C; N→P\n   Then Guess.\n3. Else (N):\n   Q2: Contain 'm' → Y→L/Pl; N→A, O, Pe, P\n4. For L/Pl:\n   Q3: Ends with 'on' → Yes→L; No→P\n5. Else for A,O,P,P:\n   Q3: Start with vowel? (A/O) → Y→A/O; N→Pe/P\n6. Then:\n   If Y→Q4: Starts with 'O'? →Yes→O; No→A\n   Or, if in A/O, can guess.\n   Else (Pe/P):\n      Q4: Start with 'P' → Yes→P each; else... Wait, but no more options.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should pick a different strategy, like binary search, using questions that split the list into two halves each time.\n\nStarting list: 8 words\n\nQ1: Is it among Cedar/Pine? (split into 2 and 6)\nIf yes→2; else→6.\n\nFor the 6 fruits:\n\nQ2: Is it among Lemon/Plum? → split into 2 and 4.\n\nIf yes→L/Pl, done in two more questions.\nIf no→4 left.\n\nFor the remaining 4: A, O, P, Pe, P\n\nWait, no—originally after first split, if answer is No, we have 6 fruits. Then Q2: 'm' → L/Pl or else.\n\nSo, for the Fruit group:\n\nAfter Q1: N→6 options\nQ2: 'm'→L/Pl or A,O,P,Pe\n\nIf in L/Pl:\n   Q3: ends with 'on'?→L; else→P\n\nElse (A,O,P,Pe):\n   Need to split again. Maybe Q4: Is it among Apple and Orange?\n      Y→A/O; N→Pe/P\nBut that would need two more questions.\n\nAlternatively, think of another way.\n\nMaybe use the last letter or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps better to map out all possibilities in terms of questions.\n\nAlternatively, let's structure it as:\n\nAfter first split (Tree/Fruit):\n\nIf Tree:\n   Two options: Cedar/Pine\n   Ask about 'a'→Cedar or Pine. Guess in 3rd question.\nElse:\n   Six fruits: A, L, O, P, Pe, Pl\n   Ask if they have 'm': L/Pl → Q2\n      If yes→two options\n         Ask ends with on → Lemon or Plum. Guess.\n      Else (A,O,P,Pe):\n         Split into two groups:\n            Q3: Starts with 'P'?→ P/Peach\n            Else→A/O\n\nBut perhaps that's too many.\n\nWait, but I think the initial approach is better:\n\n1. Is it tree? Y→C/P; N→Fruits.\n2. If Tree:\n   2 options, done in two more questions.\n3. Else (6 fruits):\n   Q2: 'm'→L/Pl or else\n      a) L/Pl: Q3 → ends with on→done\n      b) A/O/P/Pe: split into A/O and P/Pe\n          i) Split A/O→Q4: starts with O?→O; else→A\n          ii) Or, alternatively, split into Apple vs others.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me instead outline the exact questions step by step.\n\nFinal plan:\n\n1. Q1: Is the target a tree? Yes (C/P); No (Fruits)\n2. If Q1 is Yes:\n   2 options: C/P\n   Ask Q2: Does it contain 'a'? Yes→C; No→P\n   Then guess.\n3. Else:\n   Fruits: A, L, O, P, Pe, Pl\n   Q2: Does it have 'm'? Yes (L/Pl); No (A/O/P/Pe)\n      a) If yes:\n          2 options: L/Pl\n          Ask Q3: Ends with 'on'→L; else→P\n          Guess.\n      b) If no:\n          Four options: A, O, P, Pe\n          Split into two groups.\n          Perhaps Q3: Is it among Apple and Orange? Yes→A/O; No→P/Pe\n              i) For A/O: Ask Q4: starts with 'O'?→O; else→A\n                  Guess.\n              ii) For P/Pe: Ask Q4: Starts with 'P'→Yes (all); but can't split. So maybe need more questions.\n\nAlternatively, if I have four options after some splits:\n\nA, O, Pe, P\n\nI can ask a question like \"Is it among Apple and Orange?\" which would be Yes→A/O; No→P/Pe.\n\nThen for A/O:\n   Ask \"Does it start with 'O'?\" to split into O and A.\n\nFor P/Pe:\n   Since both start with 'P', but are different, perhaps another question like \"Does it end with 'e'?\" → Yes (Pe); No→P.\n\nThus, final flow:\n\n1. Q1: Is tree?\n2. If yes:\n   3. Q2: Contain 'a'? → Guess.\n3. Else:\n   4. Q2: Have 'm'? → Yes→5; No→6-8\n      a) If have 'm':\n          5. Q3: Ends with on? → Guess Lemon or Plum.\n      b) Else (A, O, P, Pe):\n           i) Split into A/O and P/Pe.\n              - Ask Q4: Among A and O?\n                  Yes→Q5: Starts with O→O; else→A\n                  No→Split into P and Pe. Ask Q5: Ends with 'e'→Pe; else→P.\n\nThis would take up to 6 questions for the Fruit group.\n\nBut since I have only 7 total, it's possible.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1. Is tree?\n   - Yes: 2-3 more\n   - No: need up to 6-7\n\nBut let's count:\n\nFor Tree case:\nQ1→Yes\nQ2→a→Guess: total 3.\n\nFor Fruit group:\nAfter Q1:No\nQ2: m?→yes/no (4th question)\nIf yes→Q3: end on→5th\nElse (A/O/P/Pe):\n   Split into A/O and P/Pe\n   Q4: A/O? → if yes, then Q5 starts with O→6th; else, in 6th, guess A.\n   If No→P/Pe:\n      Q5: Ends with e→7th (Pe); else→P.\n\nSo total of up to 7 questions for Fruit group.\n\nThus, the flow is possible within 7 questions.\n\nTherefore, the plan is feasible.\n"}}], "created": 1748389654, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 6675, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 6933, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 01:37:34.140976", "call_duration": "0:15:53.929123", "response": "The process involves systematically narrowing down the list by asking yes/no questions that split the remaining options in half each time.
