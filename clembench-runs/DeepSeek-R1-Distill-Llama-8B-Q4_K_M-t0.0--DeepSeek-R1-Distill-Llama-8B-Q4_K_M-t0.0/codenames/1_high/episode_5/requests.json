You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: europe, crash, superhero, mercury, whale, phoenix, canada, suit, spring.\nYour opponent's team words are: wave, himalayas, ice, engine, shakespeare, button, play, park.\nDistractor words are: plot, foot, snowman.\nThe kill words are: pants, pipe, tokyo, soldier, hotel."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-955ssxieeo4womvlw48at", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: big\nTARGETS: whale, crash, spring", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm given two teams of words and some additional lists like distractors and kill words. My job is to come up with a single-word clue that relates to as many of my team's words as possible without actually being one of those words or containing parts of them.\n\nSo, first, let me list out my team's words: europe, crash, superhero, mercury, whale, phoenix, canada, suit, spring. Opponent's words are wave, himalayas, ice, engine, shakespeare, button, play, park. Distractors are plot, foot, snowman, and kill words include pants, pipe, tokyo, soldier, hotel.\n\nI need a word that connects with as many of my team's words as possible, but in a way that it's semantically related. Let me go through each word:\n\n1. europe - could relate to country, maps, history.\n2. crash - might relate to accidents, cars, or even superhero-related crashes.\n3. superhero - maybe something like \"hero,\" \"action,\" or \"costume.\"\n4. mercury - planet, elements, maybe speed (like Mercury in astrology).\n5. whale - ocean, marine animals, perhaps \"big\" as in size.\n6. phoenix - mythological bird that rises from ashes, so maybe something about rebirth or mythical creatures.\n7. canada - country, geography, north.\n8. suit - could relate to clothing, law, or even as a play's element like suits in poker.\n9. spring - season, flowers, renewal.\n\nLooking for a common thread. Maybe \"big\" since whale and maybe mercury (as in size of the planet). Alternatively, \"suit\" relates to clothing, but that doesn't tie many together. \"Spring\" is about renewal or the start of something. \"Superhero\" might relate to strength or action. \"Crash\" could connect with spring if it's about accidents after spring cleaning or something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of elements: mercury is a planet name, but maybe \"element,\" but that might be too broad. \"Whale\" and \"spring\" don't connect directly. Maybe \"big\" as a word? It relates to whale (as in size) and perhaps crash (something big happening). Spring isn't directly about size. Mercury as a planet is the smallest, so maybe not.\n\nWait, another angle: \"suit.\" It can relate to clothing, which might be associated with superhero costumes. Also, \"canada\" and \"europe\" are countries; maybe \"suit\" relates to diplomatic or formal relations? Or perhaps it's more about the game itself, like in a suit-up situation.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of words that could connect multiple clues: \"big\" seems promising because it ties into whale (large animal) and crash (big accident). Maybe \"spring\" relates more abstractly as new beginnings, which might tie with superhero or phoenix. But I don't see a direct link.\n\nWait, another thought: \"superhero.\" Maybe something like \"action,\" but that's too vague. Alternatively, \"costume\" related to superhero and perhaps spring as in renewal of fashion? Not quite.\n\nHmm, perhaps \"big\" is the best fit because it connects whale (large) and crash (big event). But does it relate to other words indirectly? Maybe \"spring\" could be thought of as a big change or new growth. Alternatively, mercury is quick, so maybe \"speed,\" but that's not one of my team's words.\n\nWait, another angle: \"canada\" can be related to \"north,\" but that doesn't tie in with others much. \"Crash\" and \"spring\" might relate to renewal after a crash, but that's stretching it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"suit\" because it relates to both clothing and legal terms, but I don't see the connection to other words. Maybe \"spring\" could be linked with \"renewal,\" which ties into phoenix (rising from ashes) or superhero getting back up after a fall.\n\nWait, perhaps \"play.\" Because \"superhero\" is often about action and playtime. Plus, opponent's words include \"play,\" so using that would confuse them. But does \"play\" relate to my team's words? Maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, think of \"action,\" but that's not a word I have. Or maybe \"big\" as the clue since it connects two words (whale and crash). Let me go with \"big.\"\n"}}], "created": 1748357519, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 948, "prompt_tokens": 318, "total_tokens": 1266, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:51:59.403878", "call_duration": "0:00:41.937802", "response": "CLUE: big\nTARGETS: whale, crash, spring", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T16:53:14.807437", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'big'.

I should start my answer with 'GUESS: ' and not include any other text.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"associated with 'big'\" means. Words that are big in size, maybe symbols of something large, or concepts related to magnitude. Let me go through each word and see which ones fit.\n\nPipe – Not sure. It can be a pipe for fluids, but it's not inherently big.\nSuperhero – Yes, superheroes often have big powers or impacts.\nTokyo – It's a big city, so that fits.\nButton – Small, so no.\nWhale – Whales are large animals, definitely related to 'big'.\nPark – Could refer to a big park or just a small one; maybe.\nPlot – Not directly about size.\nWave – Could be big waves, so yes.\nEngine – Can be large in size, especially engines used in big machinery.\nSnowman – Typically not associated with something being 'big'; it's more of a thing built with big snow.\nPlay – Doesn't relate to size.\nPhoenix – Represents something grand or big, rising from ashes.\nHotel – Big hotels exist, so that works.\nHimalayas – They are huge mountain ranges, definitely related.\nShakespeare – Maybe not directly about size, unless considering his impact as big.\nSoldier – Could be part of a big military group, but the word 'soldier' isn't inherently 'big'.\nMercury – The planet is big, so that works.\nSpring – Not about size.\nFoot – Small, so no.\nIce – Can refer to glaciers or icebergs which are big.\nSuit – Doesn't relate to size.\nPants – No.\nCrash – Could be a big crash, but the word itself isn't large.\nEurope and Canada – They are big continents/regions.\n\nNow, I need to pick up to 3 words that best fit. Superhero, Whale, Hotel, Phoenix, Mercury, Europe, Canada, Ice, and maybe Park or Wave. Probably the strongest associations are with things obviously large: Europe and Canada as continents, Hotel as a big establishment, Phoenix as something grand, and Whale as a large animal.\n\nBut since I need only 3 words, let me think again. Maybe Hotel is obvious. Mercury because it's a big planet. Europe or Canada as regions. Alternatively, Wave, Ice, and Superheros are strong too. Wait, the question says 'best relate or are most closely associated'. So maybe choosing the more obviously large things.\n\nLet me pick Tokyo from the list, but wait, in my initial options, I have to stick with what's given. Wait, the given words are pipe, superhero, tokyo, etc. So Tokyo is a big city, so that fits. Superhero as representing something big and impactful. Whale as a large animal. Hotel as a big place.\n\nSo probably, GUESS: superhero, whale, hotel.\n\nWait, but the user's example answer was \"GUESS: pipe, wave, engine\". So maybe it's looking for words that are part of larger systems or structures. Pipe in infrastructure, wave as part of nature, engine as machinery.\n\nBut I need to stick with my own reasoning. Let me go with the most straightforward associations: things that are naturally big. Superhero, Whale, Hotel.\n"}}], "created": 1748357561, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 731, "prompt_tokens": 113, "total_tokens": 844, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:52:41.346365", "call_duration": "0:00:33.460530", "response": "GUESS: superhero, whale, hotel", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
