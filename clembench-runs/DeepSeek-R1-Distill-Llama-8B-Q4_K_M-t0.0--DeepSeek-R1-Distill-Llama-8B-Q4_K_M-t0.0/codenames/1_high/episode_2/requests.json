You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: atlantis, centaur, link, dog, mercury, beijing, rock, charge, sub.\nYour opponent's team words are: match, litter, bill, africa, air, cotton, bow, cross.\nDistractor words are: microscope, check, line.\nThe kill words are: crane, face, pool, foot, hand."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-stulcqxabwe9rsy3ffsqij", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nThe assistant's final response was:\n**CLUE: water**\n**TARGETS: atlantis, mercury, sub, charge, rock**\n\nThis clue effectively links multiple of the team's words through a semantic connection, aiding in quick guessing while avoiding kill or distractor words.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nAlright, I need to help this user come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of their team's words from the given list. They provided the teams' words, opponent's words, distractors, and kill words.\n\nFirst, let me look at the target words: atlantis, centaur, link, dog, mercury, beijing, rock, charge, sub. I notice that 'dog' is there. The opponent has 'bow,' which might be related to 'dog' through 'hound.' But the user's team also has 'sub,' which could be linked via 'subway.'\n\nWait, but the clue word can't be part of any target or distractor/opponent words. So maybe something that connects multiple words. Let me think: 'link' is a common term, but it's already a target. 'Mercury' is a planet, perhaps connecting to 'submarine.' Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking for words that can tie together the user's team and the opponent's without being in either list. Maybe 'crane,' but that's a kill word. 'Charge' is a user word, so maybe something like 'current'? No, not sure.\n\nWait, 'link' is a target, so perhaps a synonym. Or maybe 'bridge.' 'Sub' could relate to 'subway,' and 'dog' to 'hound.' Maybe 'pier,' but that might not fit.\n\nAnother angle: the user's team has words like 'atlantis' (ocean), 'mercury' (planet), 'beijing' (city), 'rock' (geology). The opponent has 'bow,' 'litter,' etc. Distractors include 'check,' which relates to 'charge.'\n\nWait, maybe 'water.' Atlantis and mercury are water-related, rock is part of Earth, Beijing is a city. 'Water' could link multiple words: atlantis, mercury, sub (submarine), rock as part of the Earth's structure.\n\nLet me check if 'water' is in any lists. It's not in target or opponent words. So 'CLUE: water' with TARGETS: atlantis, mercurty, sub, charge, rock seems fitting.\n"}}], "created": 1748357310, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 512, "prompt_tokens": 315, "total_tokens": 827, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:48:30.031206", "call_duration": "0:00:23.011742", "response": "The assistant's final response was:\n**CLUE: water**\n**TARGETS: atlantis, mercury, sub, charge, rock**\n\nThis clue effectively links multiple of the team's words through a semantic connection, aiding in quick guessing while avoiding kill or distractor words.", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
