You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: wind, shadow, pupil, spider, lab, glove, shakespeare, card, press.\nYour opponent's team words are: racket, rabbit, jupiter, flute, field, band, microscope, europe.\nDistractor words are: charge, snow, mercury.\nThe kill words are: bill, glass, lap, africa, chair."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-7fgqc916rz33x53llgjbrr", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: press\nTARGETS: wind, shadow, pupil, spider, lab, glove, shakespeare, card", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. My team's words are wind, shadow, pupil, spider, lab, glove, shakespeare, card, press. The opponent's team has words like racket, rabbit, jupiter, flute, field, band, microscope, europe. Distractors include charge, snow, mercury. Kill words are bill, glass, lap, africa, chair.\n\nFirst, I should look for common associations or connections between my team's words. Let me go through each:\n\n- Wind: related to weather, movement.\n- Shadow: often linked to darkness, maybe also in literature or mythology.\n- Pupil: part of the eye, could relate to optics or education.\n- Spider: an animal, maybe web-related.\n- Lab: place for experiments, science.\n- Glove: wearable, protection, sports?\n- Shakespeare: literature, plays, theater.\n- Card: playing cards, or something flat, maybe credit cards.\n- Press: could be printing, or news.\n\nNow, looking at opponent's words:\n\n- Racket: noise, sports equipment.\n- Rabbit: animal, maybe in games or fur.\n- Jupiter: planet, part of the solar system.\n- Flute: instrument, music.\n- Field: open space, maybe for sports.\n- Band: group, instruments, or music.\n- Microscope: science tool.\n- Europe: continent.\n\nDistractors:\n\n- Charge: could be electricity, or like charging a phone. Also, military charges? Not sure.\n- Snow: weather-related, maybe winter sports.\n- Mercury: planet, also the element.\n\nKill words are all single-word and don't give clues, so I have to avoid them.\n\nLooking for a word that links several of my team's words. Let me think about \"press.\" Press can relate to printing, which is related to Shakespeare (plays were often printed). Also, lab uses press for experiments, and maybe the card could be a playing card or credit card. So \"press\" seems versatile.\n\nAlternatively, \"shadow\" might link with other dark-related terms but not sure. \"Pupil\" relates to eyes, so maybe optics, which connects to microscope? That's opponent's word though. \"Glove\" and \"racket\" are in sports, but my team doesn't have those.\n\nWait, \"press\" is good because it's in both our team and could be a distractor? No, opponent has band, which is related to music, but not directly. Press on its own seems safe.\n\nSo I think the clue could be \"Press.\" It relates to several of my team's words without being too obvious.\n"}}], "created": 1748357249, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 582, "prompt_tokens": 314, "total_tokens": 896, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:47:29.817833", "call_duration": "0:00:25.227872", "response": "CLUE: press\nTARGETS: wind, shadow, pupil, spider, lab, glove, shakespeare, card", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
