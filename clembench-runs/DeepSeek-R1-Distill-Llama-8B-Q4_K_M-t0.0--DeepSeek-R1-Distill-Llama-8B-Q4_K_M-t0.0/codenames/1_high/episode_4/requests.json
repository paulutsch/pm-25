You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: ghost, time, row, web, pyramid, snow, server, shakespeare, pupil.\nYour opponent's team words are: buck, march, pan, fence, screen, cycle, circle, stadium.\nDistractor words are: calf, stick, point.\nThe kill words are: police, ninja, plate, state, agent."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-hxram7vja6dg4lfn4mjxs", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: row\nTARGETS: ghost, server", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words but also somehow ties into the opponent's or distractor words without causing my partner to guess incorrectly and end the game. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me look at my team's words: ghost, time, row, web, pyramid, snow, server, shakespeare, pupil. And the opponents have buck, march, pan, fence, screen, cycle, circle, stadium. Distractors are calf, stick, point. Kill words are police, ninja, plate, state, agent.\n\nI need to find a word that connects with at least some of my team's words and maybe some distractors or opponents'. But the clue can't be one of the team words or contain parts of them. It also can't directly hint at kill words because that would end the game if guessed.\n\nLooking at my team, 'ghost' stands out. Ghost is a common word but could relate to things like spirits, which isn't immediately obvious. Maybe through 'pupil' as in ghost pupil? Or 'web' as in spider web. Hmm. Alternatively, thinking about 'server' as in computer server or the football position. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the word 'row.' A row can be a line of something, like in a book or data. It could relate to 'time' as in time rows or 'ghost' as in ghost row? Or perhaps 'web' as in spider's web made by row after row. Hmm.\n\nBut looking at the opponent's words: circle and cycle both have to do with movement or rings. Maybe something like 'circle' relates to my team's 'web' as in a web forming a circle, or 'pyramid' which isn't directly circular but could form a circular base? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering 'fence' from the opponents could relate to 'pyramid' as in fencing around it, but that seems stretchy. Or maybe 'web' as in spider's fence. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps 'row.' My team has 'ghost,' which could be ghost row, a type of structure. Or 'server' and 'row' together as server row? Maybe, but not sure how the clue ties without being obvious.\n\nLooking at distractors: calf is an animal, stick is a tool or part of a fence, point can relate to many things. So maybe the word 'stick' relates to 'fence' from the opponent's words, and could also tie into 'web' as in spider web made with sticks? Or perhaps 'row' as in a stick in a row.\n\nWait, 'stick' is a distractor. If I use 'stick,' my partner might think of fence or cycle because of 'fence' and maybe 'stick' itself. But does it relate to any of my team's words? Maybe through 'server' as in server sticks or 'web' as in web sticks? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a word that connects both my team's and opponent's words more seamlessly. Maybe 'circle.' From the opponents, 'circle' is there. My team has 'pyramid,' which can have circular bases. 'Row' could be part of a circle. So maybe 'row' as in rows making up a circle or a circular arrangement.\n\nBut wait, my partner might guess 'circle' and if it's an opponent's word, they'd end their turn. But I need to make sure the clue is related to both sides without directly giving away opponents' words. Maybe 'web' ties into both spider web and 'screen' from opponents? Or 'server' as in computer server.\n\nWait, perhaps 'pyramid.' It relates to my team's pyramid and could connect with 'stadium,' which the opponent has. Stadiums often have pyramids or certain structures, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, 'web' might relate more because web can be used by both teams indirectly.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The clue needs to relate my team's words and maybe some opponents or distractors without being obvious. Maybe 'row' is the way to go since it can connect with both ghost row or a server row, and also tie into 'fence' as in rows of fencing.\n\nBut I need to make sure that if the partner guesses 'row,' they don't immediately end on an opponent's word. Wait, opponents have 'screen,' which is part of a row, but not directly. Or maybe 'web' as in web rows.\n\nWait, perhaps the best option is 'pyramid.' It connects with my team's pyramid and can tie into the opponents' 'stadium' if it's about structures like pyramids in stadiums or something. But I'm not sure if that's a real association.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'time,' which is on my team, could relate to opponent's 'march' as in time March, but that might be too specific and cause an incorrect guess.\n\nI think the best bet is 'row' because it can relate to multiple words without directly pointing to opponents or distractors. It ties into ghost rows, server rows, and maybe fence rows. So I'll go with row.\n"}}], "created": 1748357469, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1092, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 1405, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:51:09.861284", "call_duration": "0:00:49.530534", "response": "CLUE: row\nTARGETS: ghost, server", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
