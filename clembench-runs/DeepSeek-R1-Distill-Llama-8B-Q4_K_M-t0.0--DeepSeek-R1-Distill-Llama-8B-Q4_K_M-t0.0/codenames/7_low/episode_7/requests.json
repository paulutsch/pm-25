You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: scrubwoman, cattiness, perpetration, typeset, pilferer, electrostatics, timestamp, insurgence, gutlessness.\nYour opponent's team words are: trackside, neuropathology, dabbler, ungodliness, newsagent, bashfulness, inexistence, narrowness.\nDistractor words are: moviemaker, playact, percept, musicologist, duplicator, haircutting, townswoman.\nThe kill words are: seafloor."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-7a6ffkm7p982m6qz0vd74e", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: print\nTARGETS: typeset", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words and helps my partner guess all our words before the opponents do. My team's words are scrubwoman, cattiness, perpetration, typeset, pilferer, electrostatics, timestamp, insurgence, gutlessness.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections between these words. Let me list them again: scrubwoman, cattiness, perpetration, typeset, pilferer, electrostatics, timestamp, insurgence, gutlessness.\n\nHmm, maybe some of these can be related through a common theme or semantic link. For example, scrubwoman relates to cleaning, but I'm not sure about the others. Cattiness is like being mean, perpetration might relate to continuing something wrong, typeset could be setting type, which connects with printing or writing. Pilferer is someone who steals, electrostatics is a scientific term, timestamp is time-related, insurgence is uprising, and gutlessness is lack of courage.\n\nWait, perhaps the clue should relate to writing or literature since typeset is involved. Maybe something like 'word' because typeset deals with words in print. But 'word' might be too broad. Alternatively, considering that some team words relate to actions or descriptions: scrubwoman (housework), cattiness (mean), perpetration (continuing wrongs), pilferer (thief), etc.\n\nWait, maybe the clue should tie into literature since typeset is a term from printing. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that some words relate to negative traits or actions: cattiness, perpetration, pilferer, insurgence (uprising which can be negative), gutlessness. So perhaps a word like 'crime' could link them, but does any of the words directly tie into crime? Perpetration is committing crimes.\n\nWait, scrubwoman and pilferer are both related to stealing or dishonesty. Cattiness might relate more to mean actions. Maybe 'dishonest' isn't one of the team words, so perhaps I need a better link.\n\nAlternatively, looking for words that can tie into a theme like writing, as typeset is part of that. Or maybe something like 'print' since typeset relates to printing. But does that connect well with other words? Maybe not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for a word related to literature, like 'book'. Does any of the team words relate to books? Typeset is about setting type in books. So maybe 'book' could be a clue. Let me check if there are enough connections: typeset definitely relates to printing books, but do the other words connect with books? Maybe not directly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a word that connects to time, like timestamp. But that's just one word. Maybe 'time', but how does that connect to others?\n\nWait, maybe considering that 'typeset' is the only one related to writing or literature. So if I choose a clue related to writing, perhaps 'word' again, but too broad.\n\nAlternatively, think of 'print' as in typeset. But then again, not sure about other connections.\n\nAnother angle: 'work'. Scrubwoman works (housework), cattiness could relate to negative work ethics, typeset is a type of work in printing. Maybe 'work'? Let me see: scrubwoman – yes, work; cattiness – maybe as negative work trait; perpetration – someone who continues wrong actions; pilferer – thief, which is related to work? Not sure. Typeset – definitely work. Electrostatics is more science. Timestamp and insurgence don't directly tie into work.\n\nHmm, that might not be the best either. Maybe another approach: look for words that have similar suffixes or prefixes. For example, 'perpetration' ends with 'cation', which relates to 'ication'. But I don't know if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of 'scrubwoman' as a service-related term. But not sure how others tie in.\n\nWait, perhaps considering that 'typeset' is about organizing information, like in libraries or records. Maybe a word related to organization or order. But not seeing it clearly.\n\nMaybe the best bet is to focus on the ones connected to literature and choose a clue like 'print', even if some connections are tenuous. Alternatively, maybe 'word' as a more general clue that includes typeset but others might not fit as well.\n\nWait, perhaps 'author'. Does any word relate to authors? Typeset relates to printing books by authors. Maybe, but again, not sure about the other words.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 'cattiness' is mean behavior, maybe 'mean', but I don't know if that's a real word or acceptable.\n\nWait, perhaps 'dishonest' as pilferer and scrubwoman are related to stealing. But does that fit? Not sure.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the best clue is 'print' since typeset is part of printing, and even though others don't tie in directly, it's the strongest connection I can find.\n"}}], "created": 1748369217, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1074, "prompt_tokens": 344, "total_tokens": 1418, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:06:57.992765", "call_duration": "0:00:48.897811", "response": "CLUE: print\nTARGETS: typeset", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T20:07:55.565446", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 1 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'print'.

So that's another good match.\n\n'Gutter' might relate to the part of a printed page where text is aligned, though I'm not entirely sure if it's commonly used with 'print'. Maybe it's less likely.\n\n'Percept' could refer to perception or the act of noticing through print media, which is possible but maybe a stretch.\n\n'Duplicator' definitely seems like the strongest association as it directly relates to printing duplication.
