My team's words are saliva, bridegroom, raincoat, bridesmaid, chef, commie, statute, potion, stairwell. The goal is to help my partner guess all these quickly, but without giving away any opponent or distractor words, and of course, avoid the kill word.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all my team's words again to see if there are common themes or connections: saliva, bridegroom, raincoat, bridesmaid, chef, commie, statute, potion, stairwell.\n\nLet me think about each word and what they might relate to. \n\n- Saliva is often associated with the mouth, perhaps something like dentistry? But not sure.\n- Bridegroom and bridesmaid are related to weddings or marriage.\n- Raincoat relates to weather, maybe waterproofing?\n- Chef is clearly connected to cooking or food.\n- Commie could refer to communism or a common term for a person from a communist country, but might be more of a distractor word depending on the context.\n- Statute is legal or governmental.\n- Potion is often related to magic or alchemy.\n- Stairwell connects to buildings or structure.\n\nLooking for a single word that can connect multiple words. Let's see:\n\nPerhaps something like \"building\" could connect stairwell, but not sure about others.\nAlternatively, maybe \"uniform\": chef and raincoat both have uniforms. Bridegroom might wear formal attire, but I'm not sure. Also, does it relate to other words? Maybe, but not too many.\n\nAnother thought: \"clothing\" since raincoat, chef's uniform (though more formal), bridegroom's suit, but that's four words. Maybe \"attire\"? But maybe not.\n\nLooking for something broader. \"Structure\" could connect stairwell and perhaps others indirectly, but not sure.\n\nWait, \"uniform\" also connects to commie if we think of military or work uniforms. Chef wears a uniform too. Raincoat is like a protective clothing. So \"uniform\" could tie in several words: chef, commie (military uniform), raincoat, maybe even bridgegroom's formal wear? That's four words.\n\nBut let me check if there are any better options.\n\nAnother angle: \"building\" connects stairwell, but not others except maybe statute (as buildings have statutes?), but that's a stretch. Potion might relate to chemistry in buildings, but it's a bit forced.\n\nWait, \"chemistry\" could connect potion, but also saliva as it's a bodily fluid. But that's only two words.\n\nWhat about \"drink\"? Tequila is an opponent word, so no, because I can't include that. Chef relates to cooking, not drinks. Wait, maybe \"potion\" is more connected to magic or alchemy, which might not help much else.\n\nAnother approach: think of each word's possible connections:\n\n- Saliva: could relate to health or medical terms.\n- Bridegroom: marriage, so could relate to wedding terms.\n- Raincoat: weather gear, protection.\n- Bridesmaid: similar to bridegroom in wedding context.\n- Chef: food, cooking.\n- Commie: possibly related to communism, but could also be a term for someone from Eastern Europe if not careful.\n- Statute: legal or government.\n- Potion: magic, alchemy.\n- Stairwell: buildings.\n\nI need a word that connects as many of these. Maybe \"protection\" since raincoat provides protection, and maybe chef's uniform? Not sure about others. Or \"gear\": raincoat is gear, but others? Chef might not be gear unless in some contexts.\n\nWait, another thought: \"liquid\". Saliva is a liquid, potion is a liquid. Maybe, but not enough connections.\n\nAlternatively, \"chemistry\" connects to potion and maybe not much else.\n\nWait, considering the opponent's words: prank, campus, scrapbook, tequila, mower, groundhog, ignorance, concierge. None of these are on my team, so I can perhaps use a word that relates to some without including them. But I need to avoid their words.\n\nThe distractor words include bartender, hangman, etc., which I should also avoid.\n\nSo, \"uniform\" seems promising because it connects chef, commie (as in uniformed people), raincoat (protective clothing), and perhaps bridgegroom's formal wear. Thatâ€™s four words from my team, but let me see if there are more connections.\n\nAlternatively, \"apparel\" could relate to chefs wearing clothes (apparel) and raincoat as protective apparel, but not sure about others.\n\nWait, maybe \"structure\": stairwell is a structure in a building. Statute might be a part of legal structures? Not exactly, but possibly. Potions might relate to magical structures, but it's a stretch.\n\nAnother angle: \"service\". Chef provides service, commie might be in a service role. Bridesmaid serves in weddings. But not sure if that connects well.\n\nWait, \"costume\": bridgegroom and bridesmaid wear costumes at weddings. Chef might wear a uniform which is like a costume for work. Raincoat as protective clothing, but that's stretching it. Maybe only three words: bridgegroom, bridesmaid, chef.\n\nHmm, perhaps \"ensemble\" as in the group of people, but not sure if that works.\n\nWait, maybe \"group\": stairwell as part of a building's structure, but again, not too helpful.\n\nLet me think differently. Let me list possible connections for each word:\n\n- Saliva: medical terms, bodily fluids.\n- Bridegroom: marriage, weddings, groom.\n- Raincoat: weather gear, protection.\n- Bridesmaid: wedding attendants.\n- Chef: cooking, food, restaurant.\n- Commie: communism, or a person from Eastern Europe (but the term could be seen as derogatory in some contexts).\n- Statute: law, government, legal terms.\n- Potion: magic, alchemy.\n- Stairwell: buildings, architecture.\n\nLooking for a common theme that connects these words. Maybe \"chemistry\" because of potion and possibly nothing else. Or \"building\": stairwell and perhaps statute (if it's in a building), but not enough.\n\nWait, maybe \"protective\". Raincoat is protective, maybe chefs wear protective clothing, commie might be seen as protective in some contexts? Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: \"uniform\" connects chef, commie, raincoat. Maybe that's three words.\n\nAlternatively, \"covering\": raincoat covers, stairwell has handrails that cover the steps, but not sure about others.\n\nWait, considering \"service\", maybe from a restaurant setting: chef serves food, bridesmaid and bridgegroom are part of a wedding service, but not directly connected.\n\nAnother angle: \"group\" as in a team or a set. Maybe stairwell is part of a group of buildings? Not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the letters: S for Saliva, B for bridegroom, R for raincoat, etc., but that's probably too abstract.\n\nWait, maybe \"building\" since stairwell is in a building. Statute might be part of building codes. Potions could relate to magical buildings? Maybe stretch.\n\nBut perhaps \"uniform\" is the best bet connecting three words: chef (work uniform), commie (possibly military or work uniform), raincoat (protective clothing, which can be seen as uniform-like). That's three connections from my team. Not bad, but maybe there's a word that connects more.\n\nWait, what about \"chemistry\"? It relates to potion. Maybe nothing else.\n\nAlternatively, \"lab\": where you might find potions and maybe saliva as a biological sample. But only two words.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each word again:\n\n- Saliva: body fluid.\n- Bridegroom: marriage.\n- Raincoat: weather gear.\n- Bridesmaid: wedding.\n- Chef: food, cooking.\n- Commie: possibly related to Eastern European countries (but careful with context).\n- Statute: law.\n- Potion: magic or alchemy.\n- Stairwell: building.\n\nSo perhaps \"weather\" connects raincoat. \"Law\" connects statute. \"Alchemy\" connects potion. But I need a single word that ties as many of these together without including opponent or distractor words.\n\nWait, what if I think about \"building\"? Stairwell is in buildings, and maybe statutes are part of building codes? So that's two connections.\n\nAlternatively, \"uniform\" as before, connecting chef, commie (if uniformed), raincoat as protective clothing. Maybe three words.\n\nBut let me see if there's a better word.\n\nWait, considering the opponent's words: prank, campus, scrapbook, tequila, mower, groundhog, ignorance, concierge. None of these are in my team's list, so I can perhaps use a word that relates to some without directly including them.\n\nWait, \"service\" could relate to campus (as in university services), but also to chef and commie if they're providing service. Maybe not the best.\n\nAlternatively, \"chemistry\" connects potion and possibly nothing else.\n\nHmm, perhaps \"protective\" as a clue word, connecting raincoat (protective clothing) and maybe chefs wearing protective gear in certain settings. But not sure about others.\n\nWait, another thought: \"gear\" could relate to raincoat and maybe stairwell as part of building equipment? Not really.\n\nI think the best bet is \"uniform\". It connects chef, commie (as in uniformed officials or military), and raincoat (protective clothing, which can be seen as a type of uniform). That's three words. But are there any more?\n\nWait, maybe \"attire\": similar to uniform, but perhaps not as strong.\n\nAlternatively, \"costume\" connects to bridegroom and bridesmaid at weddings, and maybe chef in certain contexts (like themed parties), but only two or three words.\n\nI think \"uniform\" is the better choice here. It's concise and can connect to multiple team words without including any opponent or distractor words.\n\nSo, I'll go with \"Uniform\" as the clue word because it relates to Chef's uniform, possibly Commie (in a military context), and Raincoat (as protective clothing, which might be considered part of a uniform). This gives three connections. It avoids including any opponent or distractor words, and doesn't touch on kill words.\n"}}], "created": 1748372295, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2211, "prompt_tokens": 328, "total_tokens": 2539, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:58:15.756849", "call_duration": "0:01:45.899701", "response": "CLUE: Uniform  \nTARGETS: chef, commie, raincoat", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T21:00:26.724009", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'uniform'.

Raincoat - clothing item designed to be the same for all users.\n2. Swimsuit - standard issue for beachwear.\n3. Bartender - specific uniform for that job.\n4. Chef - wear uniformed attire.\n5. Bridesmaid - uniform-like dresses in weddings.\n6. Concierge - hotel staff uniforms.\n\nI need to pick up to three. The strongest connections are Raincoat, Swimsuit, and Bartender. These are all clothing items that people commonly wear in consistent designs. Alternatively, Chef or Bridesmaid could be included too, but the user asked for the closest associations.\n\nSo, the final answer would be 'GUESS: raincoat, swimsuit, bartender'.\n"}}], "created": 1748372401, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 587, "prompt_tokens": 124, "total_tokens": 711, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:00:01.663596", "call_duration": "0:00:25.060224", "response": "GUESS: raincoat, swimsuit, bartender", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T21:01:17.231881", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, from the last interaction, the user successfully guessed \"raincoat\" correctly. Then, they mentioned that \"swimsuit\" was guessed but is an innocent word. That means \"swimsuit\" is a distractor word and doesn't belong to either team. My job is to provide another clue related to my remaining team words without using any of the opponent's or distractor's words.\n\nLooking at our team's remaining words: saliva, bridegroom, bridesmaid, chef, commie, statute, potion, stairwell. I need to find a single-word clue that relates semantically to as many of these as possible. Also, it shouldn't be any of the opponent's words or contain parts of them.\n\nLet me go through each word one by one:\n\n- **Saliva**: Could relate to something like 'spit', but that seems too direct and might not cover multiple words.\n- **Bridegroom**: Maybe 'wedding'?\n- **Bridesmaid**: Also related to 'wedding'.\n- **Chef**: Could think of 'culinary' or 'kitchen'.\n- **Commie**: This is tricky since it's a sensitive term. Maybe 'group' or 'organization'.\n- **Statute**: Maybe 'law' or 'rule'.\n- **Potion**: Think of 'magic', 'spell', 'mixing'?\n- **Stairwell**: Could relate to 'stairs' or 'building structure'.\n\nI need a word that can link to multiple team words without directly using any of the opponent's, distractors, or kill words. \n\nLooking at the opponent's remaining words: prank, campus, scrapbook, tequila, mower, groundhog, ignorance, concierge. None seem to fit well with the team words, so maybe focusing on a word that ties together 'bridal' terms or 'culinary'.\n\nWait, 'gown' could relate to bridegroom and bridesmaid, but I'm not sure if it's acceptable since it might be too specific or could be part of another list. Alternatively, 'dress' is broad but still might link several words.\n\nAnother angle: 'group' for commie and possibly others. Or 'building' for stairwell and maybe others? But that seems a bit forced.\n\nHmm, let me consider each possibility:\n\n- 'Dress': Could relate to bridesmaid and bridegroom, as they wear dresses. Maybe also to chef if thinking about uniform or work attire.\n- 'Gown': Similar to dress, but more specific. However, 'gown' might be too strong for some team words.\n- 'Uniform': This was used before, so maybe not the best again.\n\nGiven that 'raincoat' was a clue related to 'uniform', perhaps using 'dress' could work better this time since it relates to two specific team words: bridesmaid and bridegroom. Also, considering that 'chef' can wear a uniform or work attire, which is similar but maybe not directly 'dress'.\n\nAlternatively, 'attire' could be another option, but the user mentioned to keep clues as short as possible. So maybe 'dress' is better.\n\nBut I need to ensure it doesn't relate to opponent's words either. Opponent has prank, campus (which relates to buildings or schools), scrapbook, etc. 'Dress' doesn't seem related to those.\n\nSo, perhaps using 'dress' as the clue, with target words being bridesmaid, bridegroom, and chef. Wait, does 'chef' really relate to dress? Not directly, unless thinking about professional attire, which is a stretch.\n\nMaybe instead, 'suit' could be another option. 'Suit' can relate to both chefs (in white uniform) and commie (as in Communist Party suit). Also, it's a single word.\n\nAlternatively, 'attire' might be better as it's more general but still relevant across multiple team words.\n\nWait, the user wants me to provide a clue and target words. Let me pick 'Suit'.\n\nTARGETS: chef, commie, bridegroom, bridesmaid (if they wear suits), but I'm not entirely sure about the latter. Maybe better to focus on chef and commie since those are more directly related to 'suit' in their professional attire.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'Robe' for potion or something else? Probably not.\n\nAnother thought: 'Gown' could relate to statute if thinking of legal gowns, but that's a stretch and might include opponent words indirectly.\n\nWait, the user wants me to provide the clue and targets. Let me settle on 'Suit' as the clue with targets being chef and commie, but perhaps others can also be included if they make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'Outfit' is another option. But again, it's longer and might not be ideal.\n\nI think 'Suit' is a good compromise because it relates directly to chef (white uniform) and can extend to other team words indirectly or metaphorically.\n"}}], "created": 1748372426, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1062, "prompt_tokens": 524, "total_tokens": 1586, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:00:26.725062", "call_duration": "0:00:50.506053", "response": "CLUE: Suit  \nTARGETS: chef, commie", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T21:01:36.422994", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'uniform'.

The goal is to help my partner guess these without them getting distracted or killed.\n\nHmm, let's see. \"Saliva\" makes me think of something related to bodily fluids, but that might be too broad. \"Chef\" and \"commie\" could relate to professions or group identities. \"Statute\" suggests laws or official documents. \"Potion\" sounds like a mix of liquids, maybe magical? \"Stairwell\" is about movement between floors.\n\nI need a single-word clue that connects some of these without being too obvious. Maybe something around the kitchen or serving? Wait, \"Chef\" and \"saliva\" can relate to food service. But how do I tie in the others?\n\nAlternatively, think of \"Potion\" as a drink or mixture. \"Stairwell\" could be about structures. \"Statute\" is formal, like laws. \"Commie\" might not fit unless it's about groups.\n\nWait, \"Potion\" and \"saliva\" can connect through something liquid. But I need to include \"chef\" as well. Maybe \"Mixing,\" but that's too generic.\n\nWhat about \"Blend\"? It can relate to mixing ingredients (like a chef), combining chemicals (potion), and maybe even statues in the sense of blending materials? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, \"Solution\" could link to statute (as a legal solution) and potion as a mixture. Maybe \"Solution\" works better. But does it fit with all?\n\nLet me check:\n\n- Chef: providing solutions or solving problems?\n- Commie: not directly related.\n- Statute: legal solution.\n- Potion: maybe as a solution to a problem in storytelling.\n- Stairwell: how? Maybe as a structure solution for buildings.\n\nHmm, \"Solution\" might be too broad. Let's think of something else.\n\nWhat about \"Recipe\"? It ties into chef and potion (as recipes are used to create things). But not directly with the others.\n\nWait, maybe \"Liquid.\" Chef needs liquids for cooking, potion is liquid, saliva is liquid. Stairwell doesn't fit here unless it's about movement related to fluids, which isn't clear.\n\nI need a better link. How about \"Concoction\"? It relates to mixing (potion) and cooking (chef). Maybe also as a group (commie)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of \"Brew\" or \"Stew,\" but those are too specific.\n\nMaybe \"Solution\" is the best option despite its breadth.\n"}}], "created": 1748372496, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 558, "prompt_tokens": 699, "total_tokens": 1257, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:01:36.424397", "call_duration": "0:00:28.252716", "response": "CLUE: Solution  \nTARGETS: chef, potion, statue", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
