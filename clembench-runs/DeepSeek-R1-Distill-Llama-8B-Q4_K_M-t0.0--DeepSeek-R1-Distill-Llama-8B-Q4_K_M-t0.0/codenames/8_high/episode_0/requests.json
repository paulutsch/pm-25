You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: fish, top, eyes, kind, matter, street, charge, club, mom.\nYour opponent's team words are: bed, company, haven, million, husband, horse, lady, eye.\nDistractor words are: family, mistake, mother, boss, evening, murder, job.\nThe kill words are: luck."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-m9g97n68nhj69baj70rmz7", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: LOOK\nTARGETS: eyes, fish, street, charge, matter, kind, club, mom", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to help create a single-word clue that relates to some of the team's words, which are fish, top, eyes, kind, matter, street, charge, club, mom. The opponent has bed, company, haven, million, husband, horse, lady, eye. There's also a list of distractor and kill words.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to connect the team's words with a single word that doesn't directly mention any of them but is semantically related. The clue can't be in their words or have parts of them.\n\nLooking at the team's words: fish, top, eyes, kind, matter, street, charge, club, mom.\n\nI notice 'eyes' is there. So maybe something related to vision or seeing. Words like 'glasses' come to mind, but that's not part of any list. Alternatively, 'look' could be a clue since it relates to 'eyes'. \n\nBut I should check if 'look' might also relate to opponent words. The opponent has 'lady', which is a title, so maybe 'look' in the sense of appearance, but I think it's safer as it relates mainly to eyes.\n\nAnother angle: 'street' is part of their words. So something like 'road' or 'path' could be clues. 'Path' might also connect to other concepts, but let me see if that connects better.\n\nAlternatively, 'charge' could relate to something like 'current' or 'flow'. But 'current' is a bit vague. Alternatively, 'stream' as in moving water, but again, not sure.\n\nLooking back, maybe 'look' is the best because it directly relates to 'eyes', which is one of their words. It's a common word that can be associated with vision and looking, so the partner might guess it quickly, covering multiple team words without being too obvious.\n\nAlso, I need to ensure that 'look' isn't part of any forbidden lists or kill words. The kill word is 'luck', which isn't related here. Distractors are things like family, mistake, etc., so 'look' isn't a distractor either.\n\nSo the clue should be 'LOOK' with targets as 'eyes, fish, street, charge, matter, kind, club, mom'. Wait, does that make sense? Let me see: 'look' relates to eyes; 'look' could be associated with seeing fish while fishing on a street, or maybe in a club or when kind matters, etc. Hmm, perhaps 'look' is too broad.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find another word that connects more specifically, but given the constraints, 'look' seems appropriate because it directly relates to one of their words and has broader associations that could hint at various others without being obvious.\n"}}], "created": 1748370010, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 602, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 914, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:20:10.399837", "call_duration": "0:00:27.125636", "response": "CLUE: LOOK\nTARGETS: eyes, fish, street, charge, matter, kind, club, mom", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T20:21:14.570979", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 8 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'look'.

First, I should understand the task: they want a comma-separated list starting with 'GUESS:' followed by the most relevant words.\n\nLooking at the word 'look', synonyms come to mind like 'see' and 'gaze'. From the list, 'eye' is definitely related because eyes are central to seeing. 'Look' can also mean observing something, so 'watch' might be a good addition, but it's not in the list. Instead, I'll pick from the provided words.\n\nI see 'eyes' and 'gaze', so those should be included. Then, 'see' is another term associated with looking. 'Kind' relates to being nice or the quality of kindness, which is linked with how you look at things. 'Matter' refers to importance, which ties into what matters when someone looks at a situation.\n\nLooking further, 'company' can be about being together, but how does that link? Maybe through observation. 'Gaze', 'eyes', 'see' are all direct. I should pick the top 8. \n\nI have: eye, see, gaze, kind, matter, eyes. That's six. Need two more. 'Watch' isn't there. Looking again, 'look' itself is in the list but it's the keyword. Maybe 'company'? Or perhaps other words like 'boss', but that might not fit well.\n\nWait, maybe 'mother' as in Mother Teresa? Or 'evening' doesn't fit. Perhaps 'husband' isn't directly related. Hmm. Maybe I can use 'matter' and 'see'. That's better. So the final list would be: eye, see, gaze, kind, matter, eyes.\n\nWait, that's only six again. Let me check the list again: club, mother, kind, top, fish, bed, eye, charge, haven, company, family, boss, mom, evening, horse, job, million, lady, luck, mistake, murder, husband, street, matter, eyes.\n\nOh, 'matter' and 'eyes' are there. So I can include those. Maybe 'gaze', 'see', 'kind'. That makes six, but the user wants up to eight, so perhaps I missed a few. Let me think again: maybe 'company' because looking at someone's company? Or 'charge'? Not really related. \n\nWait, 'look' also can mean to inspect, so 'examine' isn't there. Alternatively, maybe 'boss' in the sense of looking over a team. Hmm, not quite. 'Company' could be about looking together. Maybe include that. So: eye, see, gaze, kind, matter, eyes, company.\n\nStill seven. Need one more. Maybe 'watch', but it's not there. Alternatively, 'boss' in the context of looking over something. Not sure. Perhaps 'job' as in a job interview, where someone looks at your resume. Or 'street' as in looking around a street. \n\nWait, the user wants words that are most closely associated with 'look'. So perhaps 'eye', 'see', 'gaze', 'kind', 'matter', 'eyes', and two more. Maybe 'company' and 'charge'? Not sure if charge is related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'husband' as in looking after the family, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, 'boss' looking over someone. Hmm. I think the best fit is to stick with eye, see, gaze, kind, matter, eyes, company, and perhaps 'job' because looking for a job involves observation.\n\nWait, maybe not. 'Job' isn't strongly linked. Maybe 'luck' as in looking at luck, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, 'mistake' as in making a mistake while looking somewhere. Not sure. \n\nI think I should go with the six words and perhaps add two more that are somewhat related, even if not perfect.\n"}}], "created": 1748370037, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 864, "prompt_tokens": 107, "total_tokens": 971, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:20:37.530214", "call_duration": "0:00:37.040709", "response": "GUESS: eye, see, gaze, kind, matter, eyes, company", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
