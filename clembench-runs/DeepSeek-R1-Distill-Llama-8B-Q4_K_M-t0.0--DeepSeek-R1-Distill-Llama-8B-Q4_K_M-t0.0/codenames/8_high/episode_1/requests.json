The goal is to help my partner guess all our words before they do, while avoiding making them lose by guessing a kill word. \n\nFirst, let me list down our team's words: book, class, company, game, afternoon, man, job, times, future. Opponent's words are chance, people, miss, lunch, question, cop, reason, shit. Distractors include eyes, age, wife, door, fault, brother, bag. Kill word is day.\n\nI need to pick a clue word that's semantically related to multiple of our team's words but doesn't overlap with the opponent's or distractors. Let me go through each of our team's words and think about possible connections:\n\n- Book: Could be related to reading, studying, education.\n- Class: Also relates to education, school.\n- Company: Business, workplace.\n- Game: Entertainment, competition.\n- Afternoon: Part of the day, possibly activities like sports.\n- Man: Could relate to jobs or roles outside the home.\n- Job: Work, career.\n- Times: Clocks, scheduling, perhaps current events.\n- Future: Planning, goals.\n\nLooking for a word that connects multiple areas. \"Work\" comes to mind because it relates to job and company. Maybe \"job\" is too direct, but \"work\" could tie into both job and company. Let me check if \"work\" is used by the opponent. Opponent's words are chance, people, miss, lunch, question, cop, reason, shit. No, \"work\" isn't there. Also, not a distractor or kill word.\n\nAnother thought: \"future\" might relate to planning and job searching, but it's only one word. \"Company\" is also a strong word, connecting business with job, but perhaps too specific.\n\nWait, \"times\" could connect to scheduling or current events, which might relate to game or class times. But maybe not as broad.\n\nThinking again about \"work,\" since both \"job\" and \"company\" are in our list, \"work\" seems like a good clue because it's related to both. It's also broad enough to help guess multiple words without giving away too much information that might allow the opponent to find their own words. Plus, \"work\" is a common word so it's likely easier for my partner to figure out.\n\nI should double-check that \"work\" isn't in any of the restricted lists. The kill word is day, which is separate. Distractors are eyes, age, wife, door, fault, brother, bag. Opponent's words don't include work either. So \"work\" seems safe and effective.\n"}}], "created": 1748370074, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 596, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 908, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:21:14.575871", "call_duration": "0:00:26.858457", "response": "CLUE: work  \nTARGETS: job, company", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T20:21:59.165560", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 2 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'work'.

Job is directly about employment, and people involve interactions in a workplace. Company also strongly relates as it's where work happens. However, the user asked for up to two words, so I should select the most relevant ones.\n"}}], "created": 1748370101, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 417, "prompt_tokens": 107, "total_tokens": 524, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:21:41.439885", "call_duration": "0:00:17.725546", "response": "GUESS: job, people", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T20:22:41.313872", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

From what I remember, they have a list of team words and opponent words, along with distractors and kill words. The last clue was \"work\" related to \"job\" and \"company,\" which got \"job\" guessed but ended because \"people\" is an opponent word.\n\nSo, first, I should look at the remaining team words: book, class, company, game, afternoon, man, times, future. Oh wait, no, actually from the user's message, their remaining team words are these, and they need to find another clue that relates to some of these.\n\nHmm, let me think about how \"afternoon\" can be linked. It makes sense with \"game.\" Like, after a game, you have the afternoon. So maybe using \"game\" as part of the clue? Or perhaps linking it to something else in the team words. Wait, but they already used \"work,\" which was related to job and company.\n\nLet me consider other possibilities. \"Book\" could be linked with \"class\" or \"future.\" Maybe \"future\" is a bit broad. \"Class\" might relate to \"book,\" as in textbooks or subjects taught in class. Or maybe \"times\" as in the time of day or newspaper. But how can I make a clue that's one word related to multiple target words.\n\nLooking back, they used \"work\" for job and company. So perhaps another single-word clue that relates to two of their team words. \"Game\" could be associated with \"afternoon\" and maybe even \"man,\" but not as strongly. Or \"times\" with \"future\" or \"class.\" Wait, \"times\" can also relate to a newspaper, which might connect to \"question\" or \"reason\" in the opponent's words.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"book\" relates to \"class\" because you take classes and read books. Or \"book\" could be associated with \"future,\" as in planning for the future through reading. But I need a single-word clue that can tie together multiple target words.\n\nWait, perhaps \"game\" is connected to \"afternoon\" as in after a game comes an afternoon. So if I choose \"game,\" it relates to both \"game\" and \"afternoon.\" That could be effective because the user's team has both of these left. Plus, maybe \"man\" as in players or something else, but that might stretch too far.\n\nAnother angle: \"future\" can relate to \"class\" if you're taking classes towards a future career, or \"times\" in terms of the future times. Or \"times\" could also tie into \"reason,\" but that's an opponent word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"man\" relates to \"company,\" as in a man working for a company. But does \"company\" still need to be guessed? The user's remaining team words include company, so perhaps linking it with another word like \"job.\"\n\nWait, the previous clue was \"work,\" which included both job and company. Since they already used that, maybe I should avoid overlapping too much to prevent giving away more words.\n\nPerhaps \"afternoon\" is a better clue because it can specifically tie in \"game.\" So \"game\" as part of an afternoon activity. That way, the clue \"game\" relates to \"game\" and \"afternoon,\" which are both on their team's list. Also, if someone guesses \"game,\" they get one point, but if they guess something else like \"times,\" it might not be directly connected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"class\" could relate to \"book.\" But again, that's stretching a bit. Alternatively, \"company\" as in a group of people working together, which relates to \"man,\" but that seems too broad.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best bet is to go with \"game,\" as it clearly connects \"afternoon\" and \"game,\" both of which are on their team's list. It's also a word that could be guessed correctly without immediately giving away other words unless someone really knows the connections.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think choosing \"game\" as the clue with targets \"game\" and \"afternoon\" makes sense. It's straightforward and ties in two of their remaining words.\n"}}], "created": 1748370119, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 897, "prompt_tokens": 488, "total_tokens": 1385, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:21:59.166904", "call_duration": "0:00:42.146823", "response": "CLUE: game  \nTARGETS: game, afternoon", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
