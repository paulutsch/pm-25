You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: lawyer, bar, sense, tv, past, gun, history, haven, life.\nYour opponent's team words are: team, king, case, star, trouble, brother, dinner, moment.\nDistractor words are: hell, future, party, present, afternoon, boss, message.\nThe kill words are: bit."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-d2uaz6p38whwd6hdp9d1", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: change\nTARGETS: past history sense", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: lawyer, bar, sense, tv, past, gun, history, haven, life. The clue should be semantically connected but can't be one of the target words or contain parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the possible connections:\n\n- Lawyer and bar: Both related to legal profession.\n- Bar can refer to a place to drink alcohol, but also as a barrier.\n- Sense relates to perception or the faculty of sensing.\n- TV is entertainment or media.\n- Past refers to the time before now.\n- Gun is a weapon.\n- History is about past events and knowledge.\n- Haven is a safe place.\n- Life is about existence.\n\nNow, I need a word that ties together multiple target words without overlapping. Maybe something abstract like \"time\" since it's related to both past and sense, but the user might have thought of another word. Wait, the opponent's team has \"team,\" so maybe a word that relates to movement or direction? Or something more broad.\n\nWait, the user's example was \"CLUE: time TARGETS: past sense.\" So they used 'time' as the clue relating to both past and sense. That makes sense because time connects to past (as in past time) and sense (as in sensing change over time or the passage of time affecting perception). \n\nSo, considering that, maybe another word could be \"change\" since it relates to sense and perhaps the passage of time leading to history or evolution. But let me think if there's a better fit. Alternatively, \"existence\" could tie into life and haven, but that might not cover as much. Or \"progress,\" which might link to history, sense (as in progress of thought), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the user's example used 'time,' so perhaps another word like 'context' because sense can be influenced by context, time connects to past and future. But maybe that's more abstract. Alternatively, \"motion\" could tie into movement (gun) and change over time, but maybe not as strong.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about 'memory' since it relates to history and the past. Or 'development' which ties into life and sense of growth. But the clue should relate to multiple words, so perhaps \"movement\" because gun can be associated with moving, and sense might involve movement in perceiving. Hmm, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, the user chose \"time,\" so maybe another word like \"history\" itself, but it's one of the target words, so cannot use it. So, another approach: 'change' as a clue because past implies change over time, sense can be affected by changes, history is about changes over periods. That might work.\n\nAlternatively, 'evolution' connects to history and life, but it's longer. The user wants short clues.\n\nSo, possible options:\n\n- Time (covers past and sense)\n- Change (covers past and sense, maybe history as change in events)\n- Motion (maybe too broad)\n- Context (could relate to sense and history)\n\nBetween these, \"time\" seems the most straightforward linking two words. If I choose 'change,' it might not cover as many.\n\nWait, but the opponent's team has words like case, king, etc., so 'case' is a distractor or target? No, in this case, our target is to link our own words, so 'case' isn't one of ours. So maybe 'change' is safer because it doesn't overlap with any of their words.\n\nAlternatively, the user's example used time, which seems effective. I think sticking with a common word that clearly links multiple team words is better. So 'time' as in past and sense is a good choice.\n"}}], "created": 1748370215, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 797, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 1109, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:23:35.577228", "call_duration": "0:00:34.757329", "response": "CLUE: change\nTARGETS: past history sense", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
