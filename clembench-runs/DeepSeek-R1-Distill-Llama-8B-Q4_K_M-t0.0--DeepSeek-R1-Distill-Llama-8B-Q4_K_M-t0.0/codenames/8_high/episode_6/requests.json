You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: dinner, sex, apartment, bit, woman, street, difference, hand, information.\nYour opponent's team words are: bag, end, piece, husband, idea, month, haven, mama.\nDistractor words are: thing, song, school, date, lot, party, side.\nThe kill words are: ring."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-kng2nzqezkhkh4wu3tm1qc", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nThe user needs a clue that relates to as many of their team words as possible while avoiding any from the opponent or distractors.\n\nAfter considering various options, 'chef' stands out as it relates to dinner (a chef cooks), can relate to a woman (a female chef) and hand (used in cooking).

Let's see what they have.\n\nTheir team words are dinner, sex, apartment, bit, woman, street, difference, hand, information. Opponent has bag, end, piece, husband, idea, month, haven, mama. Distractors include thing, song, school, date, lot, party, side. Kill word is ring.\n\nThe goal is to pick a clue word that's semantically related to as many of their own words as possible, but it shouldn't be in either list and can't contain parts of them.\n\nLooking at the user's team words: dinner, sex, apartment, bit, woman, street, difference, hand, information. I need to find a word that connects several of these without being any of them or their parts.\n\nDinner is about meals, so maybe something food-related? But not too obvious. Wait, maybe 'chef' could work because it relates to dinner. Chef is related to cooking and meals. Does chef relate to other words? Sex doesn't seem directly related. Apartment maybe indirectly if a chef lives there. Woman could be a chef too. Difference? Not really. Hand? A chef uses their hands, maybe. Information, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 'woman' as a clue: but opponent's husband and woman might confuse, since husband is an opponent word.\n\nWhat about 'information'? No, because it's on the user's list.\n\nHow about 'hand'? Opponent has piece, which could be tricky.\n\nWait, maybe 'chef' is better. Let me check:\n\n- Chef relates to dinner (meal preparation) â†’ dinner.\n- Chef can also relate to difference if you think about how chefs create different dishes or have differences in skills, but that's a stretch.\n- Maybe not as strong on sex and hand.\n- Alternatively, 'apartment' as a clue. Does that connect well? Not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: 'difference'. It's directly on the user's list. But I can't use it because it's one of their own words.\n\nWhat about 'bit'? Opponent has piece, which is a distractor, so bit could be okay if related to some team words without conflicting too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 'woman' again. It's on the team and opponent's list? No, opponent has husband but not woman directly. Wait, no: opponent has 'mama' as a word, but woman is on the user's side. So using 'woman' might be risky because opponent has words like husband, which are related, but 'mama' is a distractor.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list possible clues and see:\n\n- Chef: connects dinner, maybe woman (female chef), hand (used in cooking). Doesn't directly connect to sex though. So maybe only 3-4 words.\n\n- Bit: Could relate to 'bit' itself, but not much else on the user's list. Maybe street? No, bit is a part of something.\n\n- Woman: Connects dinner (woman can cook), apartment (maybe women live there), difference (perhaps in roles?), street (women live on streets), information (not really). But opponent has 'mama', which is related to woman as a distractor. If partner guesses woman, and it's correct but also in the distractors, does that end their turn? No, if they guess correctly, even if there are distractors, but maybe the opponent might get confused.\n\nWait, no. The user's words include 'woman', which is a team word, so clue word should be something that connects to it without being in any list or part of them.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. Maybe 'chef' is better because it's related to dinner and possibly hand, but not directly to the others. Or perhaps 'apartment' as a clue, which relates to where someone lives, maybe a woman, but that might be stretching.\n\nAnother angle: looking for a word that can link multiple team words through some common theme. 'Hand' is on their list; maybe something like 'helper', but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about 'difference' as a clue because it's on the user's list, but again, it's one of their own words.\n\nWait, perhaps 'hand' itself could work. It's on the team's list, so can't use that directly.\n\nHmm, maybe 'chef' is the best bet. Let me try to see:\n\nCLUE: chef\nTARGETS: dinner, woman, hand\n\nBecause a chef prepares dinners, might be a woman, and uses their hands. This connects 3 words without conflicting with opponent's words much.\n"}}], "created": 1748370314, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1072, "prompt_tokens": 312, "total_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 20:25:14.516446", "call_duration": "0:00:48.473313", "response": "The user needs a clue that relates to as many of their team words as possible while avoiding any from the opponent or distractors.\n\nAfter considering various options, 'chef' stands out as it relates to dinner (a chef cooks), can relate to a woman (a female chef) and hand (used in cooking).
