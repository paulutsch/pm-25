You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: tokyo, tablet, ball, disease, eagle, web, missile, telescope, life.\nYour opponent's team words are: lion, africa, model, king, boom, contract, pipe, heart.\nDistractor words are: board, washington, needle, hawk, platypus, bomb, slip.\nThe kill words are: novel."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-kvssb5osjlfphwa5m9lpn", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: web\nTARGETS: tablet, web", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. My team's words are tokyo, tablet, ball, disease, eagle, web, missile, telescope, life. The opponent has lion, africa, model, king, boom, contract, pipe, heart as their team words. Distractors include board, washington, needle, hawk, platypus, bomb, slip. Kill words are novel.\n\nFirst, I need to find a word that's semantically related to some of my team's words but isn't one of them or any part of them. Let me list out the possible connections:\n\n- Tokyo is a city, maybe related to 'life' as in life in Tokyo?\n- Tablet could relate to 'web', like a tablet with web access.\n- Ball might connect with something else... Maybe 'eagle' if it's about sports or hunting.\n- Disease: Hmm, not sure. Maybe 'tablet' and 'disease' don't go together.\n- Eagle is often associated with 'boom' as in \"the eagle boom\" (though I'm not sure).\n- Web connects with tablet and maybe 'contract'? Or 'pipe'? Not sure.\n- Missile could relate to 'bomb', but bomb is a distractor. So maybe not.\n- Telescope relates to 'life' in the sense of space or stars? Or 'model' if it's a scale model.\n- Life is a broad term; perhaps connects with many words.\n\nLooking for a word that links multiple team words: Maybe something like 'web', which relates to both tablet and web. But I need to make sure it's not in the opponent's list or any distractors.\n\nAlternatively, 'life' could relate to many of my team's wordsâ€”disease, eagle (as in bird), missile (as in life on Earth?), telescope, web? Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, 'contract' is an opponent word. If I think of 'tablet', people often have contracts related to tablets or e-signatures. But not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAnother angle: 'model' could relate to telescope and tablet (like a model tablet). But model is on the opponent's side.\n\nWhat about 'eagle'? It might connect with 'ball' in sports like basketball, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, 'tablet' also relates to 'disease' if it's a medical term. Or perhaps 'life' as in a life insurance contract or something, but that might be too vague.\n\nMaybe 'web' is better because it directly connects tablet and web. Alternatively, 'life' could tie together many words: life, disease, telescope, missile (as in the age of the dinosaurs), eagle, etc.\n\nBut I need to choose a single word that's not one of the target words but related. So 'web' seems safe because it's directly linked to both tablet and web. Or 'life' which can connect multiple words.\n\nWait, the clue should be a single word that relates to some of my team's words. 'Web' is good because it connects tablet and web, maybe life as well? Not sure. Alternatively, 'model' but opponent has that.\n\nI think 'web' might be the best choice since it clearly links tablet (a device with web access) and web itself. So CLUE: web, TARGETS: tablet, web.\n"}}], "created": 1748367230, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 718, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 1034, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 19:33:50.347734", "call_duration": "0:00:31.334434", "response": "CLUE: web\nTARGETS: tablet, web", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
