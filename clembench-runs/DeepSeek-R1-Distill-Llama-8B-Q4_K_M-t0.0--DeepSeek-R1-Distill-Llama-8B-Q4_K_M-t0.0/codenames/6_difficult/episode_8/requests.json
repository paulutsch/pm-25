You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: part, spike, shot, scientist, card, buck, pass, code, calf.\nYour opponent's team words are: horse, dwarf, scale, penguin, compound, rabbit, lion, bond.\nDistractor words are: hole, bar, net, fish, force, cell, degree.\nThe kill words are: buffalo."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-e6umiik546dvsnw523fuvp", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: Calf  \nTARGETS: calf, buck", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out a good clue for the game. The goal is to help my partner guess all of our team's words before the opponents do. Our words are part, spike, shot, scientist, card, buck, pass, code, calf. Opponents have horse, dwarf, scale, penguin, compound, rabbit, lion, bond. Distractors include hole, bar, net, etc., and a kill word is buffalo.\n\nI need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of our team's words. The clue should be semantically connected but not directly one of the target words or parts of them. Let me think about the connections between our words and possible clues.\n\nLooking at \"part,\" it can relate to \"piece\" or \"component.\" But does \"piece\" fit other words? \"Piece\" could relate to \"card,\" \"shot,\" etc., but maybe that's too broad. \"Component\" is good because \"code\" relates to software components, \"scientist\" might have something to do with parts or systems. Hmm.\n\nWhat about \"calf\"? That's related to animals, and perhaps \"buck,\" which is also an animal. But does \"calf\" link well enough? Maybe not the best.\n\n\"Shot\" can be linked to \"gun,\" but \"gun\" isn't in our words. Alternatively, \"shot\" as in photo relates to \"card.\" Not sure.\n\n\"Scientist\" makes me think of \"lab,\" \"experiment,\" but those aren't on our list. Or maybe \"mind,\" which could relate to thinking.\n\n\"Pass\" is tricky; it could be a pass in sports or something else. Maybe \"hand,\" but not sure.\n\n\"Buck\" is a term for a deer, so perhaps \"animal.\" \"Calf\" and \"buck\" both are animal parts, so maybe \"calf\" can link to \"buck.\"\n\nWait, let's see: If I pick \"calf,\" then the related words would be \"calf\" and \"buck\" as they're both related to animals. That could work.\n\nAlternatively, \"code\" could relate to \"computer.\" But \"computer\" is a distractor word? No, the distractors are hole, bar, net, etc., so maybe not. Or perhaps \"system,\" which might link to \"scientist.\"\n\nBut \"system\" isn't on our team's words. Alternatively, \"component\" as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, if I use \"calf,\" then targets would be calf and buck. That's two words. Maybe that's better than a more abstract clue like \"component.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"link\" could relate to parts of a system, connecting code, scientist, etc., but \"link\" is not on the distractors. Let me check: Distractors are hole, bar, net, fish, force, cell, degree. So \"link\" isn't there.\n\nWait, but the clue has to be semantically related and can't contain parts of them. So \"calf\" is good because it relates specifically to two words on our team.\n\nSo the clue would be \"Calf,\" targeting calf and buck. That seems solid.\n"}}], "created": 1748367564, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 681, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 994, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 19:39:24.080787", "call_duration": "0:00:30.627712", "response": "CLUE: Calf  \nTARGETS: calf, buck", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
