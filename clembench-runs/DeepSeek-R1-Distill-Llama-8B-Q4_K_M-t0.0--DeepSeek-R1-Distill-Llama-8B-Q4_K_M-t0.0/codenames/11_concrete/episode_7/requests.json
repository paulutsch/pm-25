Let's start by looking at all the relevant information.\n\nFirst, my team's words are ferret, granite, arms, acorn, carton, dogs, owl, apricot, torpedo. The opponent's words are opossum, gorilla, shawl, jukebox, raft, teakettle, algae, ashtray. Distractors include taxi, serpent, tongs, teapot, lantern, handprint, blueberry, and the kill word is escalator.\n\nI need to choose a single-word clue that's semantically related to some of our team words, but not directly one of them or part of them. The goal is for my partner to guess all our words before the opponent does. So I should look for common themes or associations among our own words.\n\nLooking at our team's words: ferret (a type of animal), granite (a stone), arms, acorn (nut), carton, dogs (another animal), owl, apricot, torpedo (a projectile). Hmm, the common theme seems to be animals and related nouns. So maybe a word that ties these together.\n\nWait, let's see: ferret is an animal, as is dog. Granite is a stone, but perhaps related to something like structure or building? Or maybe it's more about the categories. Alternatively, thinking of 'carton' might relate to cartoons or animation. But I'm not sure if that ties well with other words.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a word that relates to both animals and structures? Maybe 'house'? Because granite can be used in houses, and ferret is an animal that could live near a house. Apricot also grows in trees often found around houses. Dogs and owls are common pets or animals near houses. Hmm, but 'house' isn't directly one of our words, but it relates to several.\n\nWait, but the clue word can't be from any team's words, including the opponent's, and can't contain parts of them either. So I need a word that's related but not in any list. 'House' is a good candidate because it ties into multiple aspects: animals like dogs, owls living near houses; granite used for house structures; apricot as something grown nearby.\n\nSo if the clue is 'house', then targets could be ferret, dogs, owl, apricot (since they are related to a house environment). That leaves us with arms, acorn, carton. Maybe 'carton' relates more to animation or something else, but perhaps not directly. Wait, maybe 'house' isn't the best because it doesn't tie into as many words.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of another word. 'Stone' might relate to granite and perhaps other words, but not sure about others. 'Carton' is related to paper or packaging, which doesn't tie in much. Maybe 'animal'? Because we have ferret and dogs, which are animals. But then, does that cover more words? Maybe not.\n\nWait, what about 'projectile'? Because torpedo is a projectile. But then, arms can be used to fire projectiles, so maybe that's a connection. But that might only tie in torpedo and arms, leaving others uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of 'nature', but that seems too broad. Maybe 'animal' as before.\n\nWait, another angle: some of our words are related to animals (ferret, dogs, owl), some are related to objects or materials (granite, acorn). Carton could be linked to something like a container or packaging, which might relate to other words, but I'm not sure. Apricot is a fruit.\n\nHmm, perhaps 'environment' because houses and animals live in environments. Or maybe 'dwelling', but that's similar to house.\n\nWait, maybe 'nature' as a clue would tie in many words: ferret, dogs, owl (all animals), acorn (part of nature), granite (natural stone), apricot (fruit). That seems like a strong option because it relates to multiple words. But I need to make sure the target list is only some of our team's words.\n\nSo targets would be: ferret, dogs, owl, acorn, granite, apricot. Carton might not fit as well. Arms and torpedo—maybe not directly related to nature. Hmm, so perhaps 'nature' isn't perfect because it doesn't cover arms or carton.\n\nWait, maybe 'object'? Granite is an object, acorn is an object, carton as in something made of paper or used for packaging. But again, not sure about the others.\n\nAlternatively, think of a word that ties in animals and objects. Maybe 'wilderness' but that's too long and might not be a single word.\n\nWait, another thought: 'Carton' is related to TV shows, which are animated, but maybe that doesn't tie in well with other words.\n\nAlternatively, 'food' since apricot and acorn (as in fruits) could relate, but not sure about others.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try a different approach: look for a word that is central to multiple team words.\n\nLooking again: ferret, dogs, owl are all animals. Granite is stone. Apricot is fruit. Acorn is another fruit. Carton could be related to packaging or perhaps animation (as in the show). Torpedo is a projectile.\n\nSo perhaps 'animal' as a clue would cover ferret and dogs and owl. But what about the others? Maybe not, but it's better than nothing. Alternatively, 'fruit' for acorn and apricot, but that might not tie into animals or other words.\n\nWait, another angle: 'carton' relates to animation, which could connect to maybe 'show' or 'entertainment', but that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of 'nature' again, as it's a broad category that includes all these.\n\nBut the key is to choose a word that relates to multiple team words so that when my partner gets some right, they can guess more quickly. So 'house' seems like a good bet because it ties into ferret (could live near a house), dogs and owls as pets or animals around a house, apricot as something grown nearby, and granite used in house construction.\n\nSo the clue would be 'house', with targets being ferret, dogs, owl, apricot. That leaves arms, acorn, carton, torpedo. Hmm, maybe that's okay because the partner can get those through other clues or guesses.\n\nWait, but if I choose 'house' as the clue, it's semantically related to multiple team words, which is good. Plus, it's a single word and doesn't contain any parts of the target words.\n"}}], "created": 1748376499, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1442, "prompt_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 1773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:08:19.149974", "call_duration": "0:01:04.876847", "response": "CLUE: house\nTARGETS: ferret, dogs, owl, apricot", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:09:57.960231", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 4 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'house'.

Let me go through each word one by one and see how they might relate.\n\nStarting with \"gorilla\" – that's a type of primate, so maybe it doesn't directly relate unless thinking about wildlife in a house. Hmm, not sure. Probably not the best fit.\n\nNext is \"apricot\" – that's a fruit. I don't immediately think it connects with houses. Maybe as a color? Doesn't seem to be a direct link.\n\nThen there's \"handprint\". That makes me think of fingerprints used for identification in homes or security systems. That feels like a strong connection to a house since fingerprints are unique and often used in home security settings.\n\n\"Dogs\" – definitely relate to houses because many people have dogs as pets at home. So that's another clear connection.\n\nEscalator – found in many buildings, including homes with multiple floors. It's a feature of a house, so yes, it relates.\n\nTaxi – these are usually outside, but sometimes taxi services might be called from home or used by residents, though not directly part of the house itself.\n\nTeapot – commonly found in kitchens of houses, used for making tea. So that fits well.\n\nSerpent – more of a creature, maybe in a garden setting or as a decoration, but not clearly tied to a house unless it's a symbolic element.\n\nAshtray – present in many homes where people smoke, so that relates to a house environment.\n\nArms – a bit vague. Maybe like armrests on chairs or something, but not directly associated with a house overall.\n\nCarton – could be cardboard boxes used for storage, common in houses. So that's another fit.\n\nBlueberry – again, a fruit. Not seeing a direct link unless considering it as part of a menu in a house, which is less likely.\n\nTorpedo – probably more related to water or military, not directly connected to a house.\n\nTeakettle – similar to teapot, used in houses for making tea, so that fits.\n\nAcorn – a nut. I'm trying to think if acorns are commonly associated with houses, but they're more nature-related. Maybe as bird food outside a house? Not sure if that counts.\n\nShawl – sometimes used indoors, like draped over furniture, which could be in a house. So that's another possible connection.\n\nOwl – found outdoors, but maybe in stories or ornaments inside a house, not a direct link though.\n\nOpossum – a type of animal commonly found near houses, especially in North America. So yes, it's often associated with homes.\n\nTongs – used for cooking or handling hot items, present in many kitchens. Definitely part of household tools.\n\nRaft – usually outside on water, unless part of a model or decoration inside a house. Not the best fit.\n\nAlgae – typically found in water, not directly related to houses unless in aquariums inside.\n\nLantern – used in homes for lighting, so yes, that's another strong connection.\n\nJukebox – could be in a house, especially older models. So that relates.\n\nGranite – a type of stone used in countertops, which are part of many houses. Definitely connects well.\n\nFerret – small animals kept as pets inside houses sometimes. So that's a fit too.\n\nSo compiling the list: handprint, dogs, escalator, ashtray, carton, teapot, shawl, tongs, lantern, jukebox, granite, opossum, ferret.\n\nI need to pick up to 4 words. Let me prioritize based on strongest connections. Handprint is top because of security, dogs are common pets, escalator as a feature, and maybe granite for countertops.\n"}}], "created": 1748376564, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 797, "prompt_tokens": 126, "total_tokens": 923, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:09:24.030045", "call_duration": "0:00:33.930070", "response": "GUESS: handprint, dogs, escalator, granite", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:10:40.332857", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

The game continues with their turn ending there. Now I need to provide another clue based on the remaining words.\n\nLooking at my team's remaining words: ferret, granite, arms, acorn, carton, dogs, owl, apricot, torpedo. Hmm, I should find a single-word clue that relates to several of these. \n\nLet me think about connections between these words. \"Ferret\" is a small animal, as are \"dogs\" and \"owl.\" Granite is a type of rock, but it's also used in other contexts like tools or structures. Acorn is a seed, carton might refer to something cardboard or maybe a term for an cartoon? Arms could be body parts or weapons, torpedo is a missile.\n\nMaybe I can link them all through the idea of animals and tools. \"House\" was my last clue, but that might not fit as well this time. Alternatively, thinking about things found in a house but also related to the remaining words... Maybe \"Tools\"? Because \"arms,\" \"torpedo,\" \"carton\" (maybe like cardboard boxes?), \"ferret\" if you think of ferrets as pets, which could be kept in houses with various tools.\n\nSo \"Tools\" seems to cover multiple areas: arms as body parts or weapons, torpedo as a tool (like a military tool), carton maybe used in making things, granite as building material. That should work. Now I need to list all the targets that relate to these words. \n\nWait, does \"owl\" fit into tools? Not really, but if I think of owls as animals in houses, maybe it's a stretch. But since \"house\" is already used, perhaps I can include it again or not. No, the user mentioned starting fresh with new clues.\n\nSo the targets would be ferret, dogs (pets), arms (could relate to tools like multi-tools), acorn (maybe for animals or as a seed that grows into things), carton, owl (as a bird in a house), apricot (a fruit commonly in households). Torpedo is tricky; maybe as in naval tools. Granite could be building materials. Hmm, maybe I'm stretching some connections.\n\nAlternatively, think of \"Tools\" as a broader category, so include all words that can be associated with tools or household items. Maybe it's better to include more specific connections. Alternatively, \"Carton\" makes me think of cardboard boxes, which are used for storage in houses, so maybe \"house\" again but that was already used.\n\nWait, the user wants a new clue. So perhaps \"House\" is too obvious. Let me think of other words. Maybe \"Nature\"? Because ferret, dogs, owl, acorn, etc., are all nature-related. But that's too broad and might not link well with others like granite or carton.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Birds,\" linking to owl, but again, it might not cover enough words. Hmm. \"Tools\" seems better as it can include a range of things: arms (like tools), ferret (as pets, maybe tool users?), granite for stone tools, acorn as something found in nature used by animals, carton as cardboard which is used for storage tools, owl and dogs as animals that might interact with tools or be in households.\n\nSo the clue would be \"Tools.\" Then the targets are all words related to tools: arms, granite (building material), acorn (used by animals for tools?), carton (cardboard boxes), ferret (maybe as pets using tools?), owl and dogs (just animals but perhaps in the context of a household with tools). Maybe torpedo is a bit of a stretch, but if it's related to military tools, then okay. Apricot is less obvious, but maybe as something that grows around houses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Nature\" would be better, but let me stick with \"Tools\" for now because it can include more varied words. So the clue would be \"Tools,\" and targets are arms, granite, acorn, carton, ferret, dogs, owl, apricot, torpedo.\n"}}], "created": 1748376597, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 899, "prompt_tokens": 527, "total_tokens": 1426, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:09:57.961294", "call_duration": "0:00:42.371438", "response": "CLUE: tools  \nTARGETS: arms, granite, acorn, carton, ferret, dogs, owl, apricot, torpedo", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:11:00.953805", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 4 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'house'.

Maybe \"animal\" as a clue, but I have to check if any target word starts with that or relates. Alternatively, \"nature\" was already used.\n\nWait, another angle: some of these words can be associated with structures or places where animals live. For example, granite is a type of stone, which can be found in natural settings or even in buildings. Similarly, acorn is something you might find on the ground, related to trees or nature.\n\nMaybe \"ground\" could work? Let's see: Ground relates to where things are placed, maybe where animals like ferrets or dogs go. It also ties into the idea of where acorns fall, etc. But I have to make sure it doesn't directly relate to any word that starts with \"ground.\" Looking at the target words, none start with \"ground,\" so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, considering the word \"torpedo,\" which is an object, but it could be linked to water or movement. Maybe \"water\" as a clue since \"ferret\" and \"dog\" might go near water, but I'm not sure if that's too broad.\n\nBut \"ground\" seems more directly related without being too obvious. It ties together multiple words like ferret, dogs, acorn, etc., all of which can be associated with the ground in some way.\n\nSo, I'll go with \"ground\" as the clue and include all the remaining target words.\n"}}], "created": 1748376694, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 556, "prompt_tokens": 923, "total_tokens": 1479, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:11:34.063488", "call_duration": "0:00:29.759142", "response": "CLUE: ground  \nTARGETS: ferret, granite, acorn, carton, dogs, owl, apricot, torpedo", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:12:42.304635", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 4 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'house'.

Let me look at each word and think about how it relates to the ground.\n\nFirst up is \"apricot\". That's a fruit. Hmm, does that have anything to do with the ground? Well, trees grow fruits, so maybe apricot grows on trees which are on the ground. So it could be associated indirectly through its growth.\n\nNext is \"dogs\". Dogs can be both on the ground and not. But if I think about where dogs might go or stay, sometimes they lie on the ground or play there. It's a bit indirect, but maybe.\n\n\"Escalator\" goes up, right? It's like a moving stairway. So it connects places vertically, but does it relate to the ground itself? Maybe not as strongly, since it moves upwards.\n\n\"Taxi\" is a vehicle used for transport. I don't see a direct connection with the ground unless we're talking about taxi stands or on roads, which might be considered part of the ground. It's a stretch, but possible.\n\n\"Teapot\" is for pouring tea. How does that relate to the ground? Maybe if you set it down on the ground, but that seems too literal and not necessarily a strong connection.\n\n\"Serpent\" is an animal that moves on the ground. If I imagine a serpent crawling or slithering along the earth, that's a direct association with the ground.\n\n\"Carton\" could be paper or packaging material. Not sure how that connects to the ground unless it's being used in a packaging context, like protecting something from the ground elements. That seems a bit forced.\n\n\"Blueberry\" is another fruit. Similar to apricot, it grows on bushes which are rooted in the ground.\n\n\"Torpedo\" is a military device or a type of underwater missile. I don't see how that ties directly to the ground unless it's about launching from water, which isn't explicitly about the ground.\n\n\"Acorn\" comes from trees and falls to the ground. It's definitely connected because acorns are natural objects lying on the ground.\n\n\"Shawl\" is a type of clothing. Maybe if you wear it while sitting on the ground or using it as a blanket, but that seems indirect.\n\n\"Owl\" is an animal that might perch on trees or the ground. So an owl can be seen on the ground or in trees. It has some connection to both.\n\n\"Raft\" is something floating on water. Unless we're talking about rafting over land, which isn't common, I don't see a strong link to the ground.\n\n\"Algae\" grows in water and on surfaces. It doesn't directly relate to the ground unless it's on the ground, like in ponds or soil, but that's stretching it.\n\n\"Lantern\" is something you might use when walking around at night on the ground. So it's associated with being used in the ground environment.\n\n\"Jukebox\" is an electronic device for music. It doesn't seem to connect well with the ground unless it's placed somewhere on the floor, but that's too literal.\n\n\"Granite\" is a type of stone found on the ground. Rock formations are part of the earth's surface, so granite definitely relates to the ground.\n\n\"Ferret\" is another animal that might move around on the ground or even dig in the ground. So it has some association.\n\nThinking through all these, the words like \"ground\", \"serpent\", \"owl\", and \"granite\" stand out as having strong connections with the earth or being found on the ground. \"Serpent\" moves along the ground, \"owl\" can perch there, and \"granite\" is part of the earth itself.\n\nSo, I'll go with serpent, owl, and granite.\n"}}], "created": 1748376723, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 803, "prompt_tokens": 591, "total_tokens": 1394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:12:03.824128", "call_duration": "0:00:38.480353", "response": "GUESS: serpent, owl, granite", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:13:17.230874", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

Let me look at these words and think about common themes or categories they might fit into.\n\nFerret, granite, acorn, carton, dogs, owl, apricot, torpedo.\n\nHmm... \"ferret\" makes me think of animals, specifically small mammals. \"Granite\" is a type of stone, but it's also the name of the Granite State, maybe? Not sure if that helps. \"Acorn\" is a nut. \"Carton\" could refer to packaging or perhaps the TV show? Probably not relevant here. \"Dogs,\" \"owl\" are animals again. \"Apricot\" is a fruit, and \"torpedo\" is a submarine, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, \"ferret,\" \"dogs,\" \"owl\" all relate to animals. Maybe I can go with something related to nature or animals as the clue.\n\nLooking at the list, \"ground\" comes to mind because it relates to where these animals might be found or in proximity. Let me see:\n\n- Ferrets are often kept in burrows or dens, which is ground level.\n- Dogs and owls live in various environments on the ground.\n- Granite can be found naturally on the ground.\n- Acorn is a type of tree nut, which grows from trees on the ground.\n- Carton... not sure about that one. Maybe it's just packaging, so perhaps less related to ground.\n- Apricot trees grow on the ground.\n- Torpedo could imply movement across the ground.\n\nOkay, \"ground\" seems like a plausible clue. It connects ferret, dogs, owl, granite, acorn, apricot, and torpedo, which are all my remaining target words.\n\nNow, I should check if any opponent's words or distractors relate to \"ground.\" Opponents have shawl, jukebox, raft, algae. Jukebox is a place where music is played, so maybe not. Shawl is fabric, rafts are for floating on water, and algae is a plant that grows in water or on ground. So \"ground\" might indirectly relate to algae.\n\nDistractors like taxi (a vehicle on the ground), teapot (on a table, which is on the ground), lantern, blueberry (a fruit, but not directly tied). So \"ground\" seems safe and relates to multiple team words without causing confusion.\n\nI think that's a good choice.\n"}}], "created": 1748376762, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 631, "prompt_tokens": 1106, "total_tokens": 1737, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:12:42.305899", "call_duration": "0:00:34.924817", "response": "CLUE: ground  \nTARGETS: ferret, dogs, owl, granite, acorn, apricot, torpedo", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:13:46.664419", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 4 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'house'.

First, let's see what the options are. The words provided are: apricot, dogs, escalator, taxi, teapot, carton, blueberry, torpedo, acorn, shawl, owl, raft, algae, lantern, granite, ferret.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about each word and how it relates to ground. \n\nApricot – that's a fruit, so maybe not directly related to the ground itself, but maybe used in something on the ground.\n\nDogs – dogs can be on the ground, like when they're walking or running around.\n\nEscalator – this is a machine that moves upwards and downwards, so it's on the ground level in buildings.\n\nTaxi – a taxi is a vehicle that travels on the ground, picking up passengers.\n\nTeapot – a teapot is used for making tea, which might be on the ground surface.\n\nCarton – I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe like a cardboard box? Not directly related to ground.\n\nBlueberry – another fruit, similar to apricot, so perhaps not as tied to the ground itself.\n\nTorpedo – this is tricky. It can refer to a weapon, but it's also used in water for submarines. So maybe on the ground, it doesn't have a direct link.\n\nAcorn – these are small oak trees that fall from trees onto the ground.\n\nShawl – used by people, so it might be placed on the ground when someone is sitting or lying down.\n\nOwl – birds fly above the ground but can perch on the ground.\n\nRaft – something floating on water, not really on the ground.\n\nAlgae – found in water and can grow on surfaces, maybe like the ground near water.\n\nLantern – used for lighting, placed on the ground to provide light.\n\nGranite – a type of stone that's part of the ground itself, commonly used in buildings or paving.\n\nFerret – small animals that live on or near the ground.\n\nSo, from this analysis, the words that most directly relate to the ground are: apricot (as fruit on ground), dogs, escalator (on ground floors), taxi (on ground streets), teapot (placed on ground surfaces), acorn (fallen from trees onto ground), shawl (used on the ground), owl (perches on ground), algae (grows on ground near water), lantern (placed on ground for lighting), granite (part of the ground structure), and ferret (lives near or on the ground).\n\nI think I have enough here to compile a list. But I need to make sure it's up to 8 words.\n"}}], "created": 1748376797, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 583, "prompt_tokens": 723, "total_tokens": 1306, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:13:17.232311", "call_duration": "0:00:29.431949", "response": "GUESS: apricot, dogs, escalator, taxi, teapot, acorn, shawl, owl", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
