You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: parallelism, materialism, misguidance, insentient, discordance, cunningness, possessiveness, newness, unbelief.\nYour opponent's team words are: predictability, insubordination, totality, paradigm, existence, panache, ethos, utilization.\nDistractor words are: interpretation, plausibility, cheapness, flimflam, nationalization, curiosity, spirituality.\nThe kill words are: misanthropy."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-zg0o2o0b64jn0e5clopuv", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: newness  \nTARGETS: parallelism, materialism, possessiveness, unbelief", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nAlright, I need to help the user find a single-word clue that relates to some of their team's words from the given list. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the user's team words: parallelism, materialism, misguidance, insentient, discordance, cunningness, possessiveness, newness, unbelief. The opponent's team has predictability, insubordination, totality, paradigm, existence, panache, ethos, utilization. Distractors include interpretation, plausibility, cheapness, flimflam, nationalization, curiosity, spirituality, and the kill word is misanthropy.\n\nThe goal is to pick a clue that links to multiple target words but isn't one of them or a part of them. The better the clue relates, the more likely the partner can guess quickly, but it should be tricky enough that they might not easily get distracted by opponents' words.\n\nLooking at the user's words, \"newness\" stands out because it's a common term and could relate to several team words indirectly. Newness often goes hand in hand with change or transition, which might tie into things like parallelism (as in parallel changes) or newness itself being a trait related to materialism (like a new materialistic approach). It also touches on possessiveness (maybe wanting something new), unbelief (challenging the old beliefs).\n\nNow, checking the opponent's words: predictability and totality. \"Newness\" doesn't relate to these directly, so it should be a good clue without attracting opponent guesses.\n\nI need to make sure that \"newness\" isn't a word in any listâ€”it's not in the team or distractor words, and the kill word is misanthropy, so that's safe. Also, ensure none of the target words are part of \"newness.\"\n\nPutting it all together, \"newness\" seems to be the best fit because it connects well with several team words without overlapping with opponents' terms.\n"}}], "created": 1748377507, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 439, "prompt_tokens": 337, "total_tokens": 776, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:25:07.564443", "call_duration": "0:00:19.027655", "response": "CLUE: newness  \nTARGETS: parallelism, materialism, possessiveness, unbelief", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
