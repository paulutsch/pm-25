The goal is to give clues that relate to their own team's words without giving away any words from the opponent's or distractors. They also need to make sure not to include kill words.\n\nIn the history, I gave a clue of \"time\" related to \"heyday\" and \"endlessness.\" But now \"endlessness\" was guessed and it belongs to the opponent, so the turn ended there. Now, I need to provide another clue without repeating any target words from either team or using distractors.\n\nLooking at the remaining words for my team: afterworld, probability, existentialism, bonkers, ungodliness, heyday, imposition, cunningness, ambivalence.\n\nThe opponent's remaining words: desirability, extent, atonement, misconception, volition, humbug, dissolution.\n\nDistractors are still uselessness, readiness, synthesis, misperception, perpetration, materialism, pacifism.\n\nKill word is steadfastness.\n\nI need to find a single-word clue that's related to as many of my team's words as possible. Let's see:\n\n- Afterworld: could relate to 'afterlife' or something like 'eternity.'\n- Probability: relates to chance, statistics.\n- Existentialism: deals with existence and deep thoughts.\n- Bonkers: crazy, nuts.\n- Ungodliness: perhaps related to ethics or morality, but maybe more abstract.\n- Heyday: prosperity, peak time.\n- Imposition: maybe like adding something forcefully, which could relate to 'impose' but not sure.\n- Cunningness: cleverness, trickiness.\n- Ambivalence: having conflicting feelings.\n\nLooking for a word that can connect several. \"Eternity\" comes to mind because it relates to afterworld and endlessness (though endlessness is gone). It also touches on existentialism themes of existence over time.\n\nDoes \"eternity\" relate well? Let's see:\n\n- Afterworld: yes, as it's the next life.\n- Probability: maybe not directly, but perhaps in terms of infinite possibilities.\n- Existentialism: definitely, as it deals with the meaning of existence and time.\n- Bonkers: maybe metaphorically as something eternal can be seen as crazy if someone doesn't agree.\n- Ungodliness: could relate to an eternal perspective beyond religious beliefs.\n- Heyday: might not connect, but perhaps as a peak time that feels endless.\n- Imposition: not directly, unless talking about forcing eternal concepts.\n- Cunningness: maybe in terms of eternal strategies or tricks.\n- Ambivalence: possibly regarding eternal decisions and mixed feelings.\n\nThat seems to cover many of the words. Now, I need to ensure none of the targets are from the opponent's list. The opponent has desirability, extent, atonement, misconception, volition, humbug, dissolution. None of these relate directly to eternity.\n\nAlso, check distractors: uselessness, readiness, synthesis, misperception, perpetration, materialism, pacifism. \"Uselessness\" is a distractor but not relevant here. The other distractors don't really fit with eternity.\n\nLastly, kill word is steadfastness, which means being constant, so it doesn't interfere since the clue isn't about that.\n\nSo, the clue seems safe and relates to many of my team's words without stepping into opponent territory or using a kill word.\n"}}], "created": 1748377314, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 741, "prompt_tokens": 531, "total_tokens": 1272, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 22:21:54.376579", "call_duration": "0:00:36.071289", "response": "CLUE: eternity  \nTARGETS: afterworld, existentialism, heyday", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T22:22:39.219328", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 2 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'time'.
