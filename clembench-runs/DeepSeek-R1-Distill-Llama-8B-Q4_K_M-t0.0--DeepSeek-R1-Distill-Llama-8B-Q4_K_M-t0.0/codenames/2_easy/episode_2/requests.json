My team's words are garden, lightning, rattlesnake, aids, hiv, hepatitis, asp, cyclone, copperhead. The opponent has rabbit, gin, zebra, vodka, champagne, whiskey, sheep, rhinoceros. Distractors include firefighter, sodium, acid, carpenter, mercury, scientist, teacher. Kill word is table.\n\nI should pick a clue that's semantically connected to at least some of my team's words. Let me look at each word and see possible connections. Garden relates to plants or maybe something with animals? Lightning could be associated with thunderstorms or perhaps something electrical. Rattlesnake is an animal, so maybe something related to animals. Aids, HIV, hepatitis are diseases, which might relate to science or medical terms.\n\nLooking for a clue word that connects multiple target words without being one of them or their parts. Maybe something like \"animal\" since rattlesnake and others are animals, but the opponent also has animal-related words like sheep, rabbit, etc., so I need to find a connection only to my team's words.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \" venomous,\" as both rattlesnake and copperhead are venomous. But \"venom\" isn't on either list, and it might not be a single word. Or think of something like \"herpetic,\" but again, that might not fit.\n\nWait, the user's example used \"snake\" relating to both lightning (thunder is part of thunderstorms) and rattlesnake, as well as asp (which is a type of snake). Also, garden could be where snakes live. So \"snake\" connects multiple target words: lightning (as in thunderstorm), rattlesnake, asp, and maybe even copperhead if they are types of snakes.\n\nLet me check the opponent's words: zebra, sheep, rabbitâ€”they're animals but not directly related to snakes except maybe none. So \"snake\" might only relate to my team's words, avoiding the opponent's.\n\nIs there a better word? Maybe \"storm,\" connecting lightning and cyclone. But does it connect enough? It can link lightning and cyclone (both storm-related), but what about garden? Not really. Alternatively, \"toxic,\" as in aids, HIV, hepatitis, which are diseases that could be toxic. But \"toxic\" might not cover all.\n\nAlternatively, \"serpentine,\" but that's longer. So \"snake\" seems to fit better, connecting several of my team's words without conflicting with opponent's.\n"}}], "created": 1748358545, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 568, "prompt_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 891, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 17:09:05.855084", "call_duration": "0:00:26.105033", "response": "CLUE: snake\nTARGETS: lightning, rattlesnake, asp, cyclone", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T17:10:06.733996", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 4 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'snake'.

The user provided a bunch of words and wants up to four of them that best relate to the word 'snake'. They also mentioned starting the response with 'GUESS:' followed by comma-separated words.\n\nFirst, let me think about what snakes are associated with. Snakes can be venomous or non-venomous, and they come in various types. So I should look for words that are either synonyms, related through context, or have some connection to snakes.\n\nLooking at the list: gin, whiskey, table, firefighter, scientist, garden, cyclone, carpenter, teacher, zebra, copperhead, hiv, vodka, mercury, rattlesnake, hepatitis, sodium, lightning, rabbit, acid, sheep, aids, rhinoceros, asp, champagne.\n\nLet me go through each word and see how it relates to snakes:\n\n- Gin: Hmm, not directly related. Unless thinking about 'snake' as slang for a drinking establishment, but that's a stretch.\n- Whiskey: Similar to gin, maybe in context of watering holes, but not strongly connected.\n- Table: Maybe in the sense of snake games or something, but unclear.\n- Firefighter: No obvious connection.\n- Scientist: Maybe in the field of herpetology, which studies snakes. So that's a possible link.\n- Garden: Snakes can be found in gardens, so this makes sense.\n- Cyclone: Not directly related, unless considering weather-related dangers to snakes.\n- Carpenter: No clear connection.\n- Teacher: Maybe as a profession unrelated to snakes.\n- Zebra: The animal, but not sure how it connects to snake.\n- Copperhead: Oh, that's a type of venomous snake! So definitely relevant.\n- HIV: While it's a disease, I don't see a direct snake link unless in a metaphorical sense.\n- Vodka: Again, more about drinking.\n- Mercury: Could refer to mercury poison, which snakes might be affected by. Or Mercury the planet?\n- Rattlesnake: Direct synonym.\n- Hepatitis: A disease, perhaps not directly connected.\n- Sodium: No relation I can see.\n- Lightning: Maybe in terms of lightning strikes affecting snakes, but that's a stretch.\n- Rabbit: No connection.\n- Acid: Could relate to venom's acidity, but not certain.\n- Sheep: No connection.\n- aids: Similar to HIV, more about diseases.\n- Rhinoceros: The animal, but how does it connect to snake?\n- Asp: That's another type of venomous snake! So definitely relevant.\n- Champagne: Unrelated.\n\nSo the words that strongly relate are 'rattlesnake' and 'copperhead', as they're types of snakes. Then 'scientist' because they study snakes, and 'garden' where snakes can be found. Maybe 'teacher' if thinking about snake handling or education, but not as strong. Alternatively, 'acid' relates to some venoms. Wait, maybe 'rattlesnake', 'copperhead', 'scientist', and 'garden' would make four.\n\nWait, let me double-check: The user wants up to four words related or most closely associated with 'snake'. So I need to pick the best four. 'Rattlesnake' is a type of snake. 'Copperhead' is another type. 'Scientist' as in herpetologist. 'Garden' as where snakes live.\n\nAlternatively, considering other words: 'asp' is a venomous snake. But since the user already provided it in the list, perhaps including that would make sense. However, the initial response included 'rattlesnake', 'copperhead', 'scientist', and 'garden'. That seems appropriate.\n"}}], "created": 1748358571, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 810, "prompt_tokens": 118, "total_tokens": 928, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 17:09:31.971287", "call_duration": "0:00:34.762514", "response": "GUESS: rattlesnake, copperhead, scientist, garden", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T17:10:24.083815", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.
