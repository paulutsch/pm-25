My team has stadium, yard, europe, snowman, gold, stream, cliff, plane, chair. Opponent has lab, port, cell, sock, wake, belt, link, line. Distractor words are plastic, scale, police, boot, copper, ice, web, hand. Kill words are not listed.\n\nThe goal is to give a clue that helps my partner guess all our words before the opponent does. The clue should be semantically related and can connect to multiple of our own words, but it shouldn't be one of the words or contain parts of them. Let me think about possible connections.\n\nLooking at the words: stadium connects with games or sports, yard is land near a house, europe relates to geography, snowman is winter, gold is a precious metal, stream is water, cliff is a geographical feature, plane can mean flight or a body part, chair is furniture. Hmm.\n\nThe opponent's words are mostly related to things like lab (science), port (transportation/harbor), cell (biology or phone), sock (clothing), wake (water or movement after death?), belt (clothing or tool), link (connection, DNA?), line (like in geometry).\n\nI need a clue that connects to multiple of my team's words. Let me think about common themes. Maybe something like 'ground' since yard and maybe stream are on the ground. Or 'landscape' because of yard and cliff? Or maybe 'nature' because of snowman, stream, cliff.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- stadium: games, sports\n- yard: garden or area\n- europe: continent\n- snowman: winter, snow\n- gold: precious metal\n- stream: water flow\n- cliff: rocks\n- plane: could relate to flight or anatomical part\n- chair: furniture\n\nOpponent's words: lab, port, cell, sock, wake, belt, link, line.\n\nWhat connects stadium, yard? They are both related to land. Maybe '土地' but that's Chinese. In English, maybe 'land', but it's not specific enough.\n\nAlternatively, think of words like 'geography' or 'terrain' because of yard and cliff. Or 'earth' which ties into many things, including stream, cliff, gold? Gold is a metal, though.\n\nWait, another angle: 'elements' as in elements of the Earth—like stone (cliff), water (stream), but that's more than one word. Alternatively, 'rock' could connect to cliff, maybe. But rock isn't on our list.\n\nAlternatively, think about 'place' as in a location—stadium is a place, yard is an area, Europe is a place. So maybe 'place'? Not sure if that's too generic or not, but it's worth considering.\n\nOr perhaps 'area', since yard and stream can be areas. But I'm not sure if the opponent would find it hard to guess. Wait, let me think about the clue's effectiveness. The clue needs to make my partner think of multiple of our words but be tricky enough for them to have to figure out, so they don't get distracted by the opponent.\n\nMaybe 'ground' as in yard and stream. Or 'land' again. Alternatively, 'slope' because of cliff? But that's specific.\n\nWait, another thought: 'animal'. But none of our words are animals directly except maybe 'chair' as something with legs, but that's a stretch. Not sure if that works.\n\nAlternatively, 'structure': stadium, plane, chair—yes, those are structures. So 'structure' could connect stadium, plane (as in airplane), chair. That's three words, which is good. Let me check: structure connects to stadium (a large structure for sports), plane (an aircraft, a type of structure?), chair (furniture as a structure). So yes, that seems possible.\n\nWait, the opponent has 'link', but I don't think structure would connect to their words. Their words are more lab, port, etc., which might not directly relate to structure.\n\nSo 'structure' could be a good clue connecting stadium, plane, and chair. That's three of our words. It's semantically related, and it shouldn't contain any parts of the words from my team or the opponent's.\n\nYes, I think that works.\n"}}], "created": 1748355235, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 934, "prompt_tokens": 314, "total_tokens": 1248, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:13:55.556946", "call_duration": "0:00:42.163288", "response": "CLUE: structure\nTARGETS: stadium, plane, chair", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T16:14:58.326075", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'structure'.

Let's see the current situation.\n\nFrom the previous interaction, the user provided their team's words and set a clue relating some of them. Now, in this new query, the user is providing an update where the word \"web\" was guessed but it's considered innocent. So, the turn ended there, and they need another clue with updated target words.\n\nLooking at the remaining team words: stadium, yard, europe, snowman, gold, stream, cliff, plane, chair. Opponent’s remaining words are lab, port, cell, sock, wake, belt, link, line. Distractor words haven’t changed except for web being removed or not? Wait, actually, in the new query, the distractors are plastic, scale, police, boot, copper, ice, hand—same as before, but web was a guess, so maybe it's been used or considered. Kill words are still the same.\n\nI need to find a single-word clue that relates to at least some of the user's remaining team words. The clue shouldn't be in either list and can't include parts of them. Let me think about the team words.\n\nStadium, plane, chair—these all seem related to structures. Europe could be considered as a continent, but structure is more about buildings or things built by humans. Stream, cliff, snowman, gold, yard... Hmm. Maybe \"structure\" was too broad before and led to web. So perhaps I need another clue that's specific enough.\n\nLooking at the user’s remaining words, maybe focus on something like Europe—maybe a clue related to history or geography. Or perhaps something more abstract. Let me think about each word:\n\n- Stadium: could relate to events, maybe structure again.\n- Yard: garden area, possibly related to nature.\n- Europe: continent, but also history, culture.\n- Snowman: winter, maybe related to weather or seasons.\n- Gold: wealth, treasure, perhaps minerals?\n- Stream: body of water, flow, maybe related to water sources.\n- Cliff: geographical feature, might relate to structures like buildings on cliffs.\n- Plane: could be a type of vehicle or the place, but also structure.\n- Chair: furniture.\n\nMaybe I can find a word that connects multiple team words. Let's see—chair and plane are both things you sit on in, perhaps, entertainment or relaxation? Maybe \"furniture\" as a clue? But furniture is broad and might include distractors like chair or other words.\n\nAlternatively, considering structure again but with more specificity. Wait, the previous clue was \"structure,\" which led to web. So maybe I need something else that's not too obvious. How about \"connection\"? Stream connects places, plane can connect cities, Europe connected by various means. But does \"connection\" relate to all? Maybe.\n\nBut wait, let's see if any words in the opponent's list could be related. Opponent’s words are lab, port, cell, sock, wake, belt, link, line. If I pick a clue like \"cell,\" that's an opponent word and would end the turn if guessed correctly or incorrectly. So maybe not.\n\nWhat about \"link\"? It's on both sides—opponent has it, but so do some distractors? Not sure. Alternatively, thinking of something that connects multiple team words without overlapping with opponents' or distractors'.\n\nLooking back at team words, stream, plane, chair could be linked through \"flow\" or movement. But flow isn't a word. Alternatively, \"route\"—like how planes take routes. Or maybe \"path,\" but not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe \"location.\" Europe is a continent, so location makes sense. Stadium, yard, stream, etc., all can be considered locations. But that's broad.\n\nWait, the user mentioned web was guessed and it's innocent. So perhaps using something more specific now. Let me think—stadium is where events happen; maybe \"event.\" But event might relate to things like concerts, which could link with plane and chair if they're in an airplane or concert venue.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of structure again but being cautious not to include web. Maybe another word related to structures? Or perhaps something else entirely.\n\nI think I need a clue that is both relevant to multiple team words without leading to the opponent's list. Let me go through each team word and see possible clues:\n\n- Stadium: Could relate to \"building\" or \"structure,\" but those were tried before.\n- Yard: Maybe \"garden\" or \"outdoor.\"\n- Europe: Perhaps \"continent\" or \"travel.\"\n- Snowman: Maybe \"winter\" or \"holiday.\"\n- Gold: Could be \"treasure\" or \"metal.\"\n- Stream: Maybe \"water\" or \"flow.\"\n- Cliff: Could relate to \"geography\" or \"hiking.\"\n- Plane: Maybe \"airplane\" or \"transport.\"\n- Chair: Could be \"furniture.\"\n\nLooking at these, perhaps \"travel\" could tie in with Europe and plane. But also might link to other team words indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, \"location\" ties into stadium, yard, stream, cliff, etc., but it's broad. Maybe too vague.\n\nAnother idea: \"route.\" Planes take routes; streams flow through routes; maybe that connects stream and plane. Or \"path,\" as in a hiking path on a cliff or the flow of a stream.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the clue is semantically related without being too obvious, so the partner doesn't guess it too quickly but still gets all the team words.\n\nHmm, perhaps \"connection\" again, but I'm not sure if that's too broad. Let me try to pick one and see.\n"}}], "created": 1748355298, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1200, "prompt_tokens": 489, "total_tokens": 1689, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:14:58.327518", "call_duration": "0:00:56.643593", "response": "CLUE: structure  \nTARGETS: stadium, plane, chair", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T16:16:24.952945", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'structure'.

So I need to find another set of words that relate more closely to structure.\n\nFirst, let me think about what 'structure' means. It refers to something organized or built, like a building, a machine, or even a natural formation. Looking at the list:\n\n- 'stadium': That’s definitely a structure, like a sports stadium.\n- 'chair': Also a structure, something you can sit on.\n- 'lab': A laboratory is a structured environment for experiments.\n\nAre there others? Let me check each word:\n\n- **stream**: More like flowing water, not really a structure.\n- **europe**: A continent, doesn't relate.\n- **wake**: Could refer to a wakeboarding spot, which has some structure but isn't the primary term.\n- **boot**: A footwear or maybe the boot as in computing, but not directly linked.\n- **snowman**: An assembly of snow, but more playful than a structure.\n- **belt**: Could be part of a structure, like in machinery, but it's more of a component.\n- **plastic**: Doesn't specifically refer to structure itself.\n- **line**: Maybe as in a structural line or grid, but not directly.\n- **port**: A place where ships dock, which has some structure but not the main term.\n- **hand**: Not related at all.\n- **cliff**: A natural formation, more of a landscape than a built structure.\n- **yard**: Could be a structured garden area.\n- **gold**: Doesn’t relate.\n- **lab**: Already considered as a good option.\n- **chair**: Also good.\n- **police**: Not related directly.\n- **ice**: Maybe structural ice in construction, but not common.\n- **plane**: Aeronautical structure, but 'stadium' is more fitting.\n- **cell**: Could be cellular structures in biology or buildings, which might relate.\n- **sock**: Doesn't make sense here.\n- **copper**: Doesn't fit unless it's about materials used in structures, but not directly.\n- **scale**: Maybe as in measuring structures, but again not the term.\n\nSo, considering all this, 'stadium', 'chair', and 'lab' seem to best relate to structure. They are tangible things that have defined forms or purposes. 'Stadium' is a large built structure for events, 'chair' is a man-made object with a specific function, and 'lab' refers to a space designed for experiments or analysis.\n\nI should make sure I'm not including any words that don't fit. Let me double-check:\n\n- 'stadium', 'chair', 'lab' - these all clearly refer to structures.\n- The other suggestions might be too tangential or unrelated.\n\nYes, I think that’s a solid choice.\n"}}], "created": 1748355354, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 677, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 923, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:15:54.973353", "call_duration": "0:00:29.979295", "response": "GUESS: stadium, chair, lab", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T16:16:55.175828", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

The opponent's remaining words are port, cell, sock, wake, belt, and line. I also need to avoid giving clues that relate to distractors or kill words.\n\nFirst, let me look at the remaining words we have. Yard, Europe, snowman, gold, stream, cliff, and plane. These all seem pretty different from each other, so I need a clue that can tie together some of these words without being too obvious.\n\nYard is associated with places or areas, maybe something like \"area\" or \"plot.\" But I need to find a word that connects to multiple words on our list. Europe is a continent, but it's also related to the term \"European,\" which might connect to other words as well. Snowman is more about winter or holidays, gold is a precious metal or something related to treasure or wealth, stream relates to water or maybe rivers, cliff is a geographical feature, and plane can be a type of vehicle (like an airplane) or a flat surface.\n\nHmm, maybe the word \"ground\" could work since yard is part of the ground, Europe doesn't directly relate but maybe metaphorically. Wait, no, ground might not connect well with all the words. Maybe \"land\"? That connects to yard and maybe Europe as a continent. Let me think about how each target word relates to land.\n\nYard: Definitely related to land.\nEurope: A continent, which is land.\nSnowman: People often build snowmen in lands (yards).\nGold: Gold is often associated with treasures or wealth, but not necessarily land directly.\nStream: Land has streams flowing through it.\nCliff: Part of the landscape.\nPlane: Can refer to flat ground.\n\nI'm not sure if \"land\" is strong enough because gold and plane might not strongly connect. Maybe there's a better word that can tie more words together. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\n\"Space\" could be another option. Yard, Europe (as in the continent), stream (as part of a landscape), cliff, but I'm not sure about snowman or gold fitting here as well.\n\nMaybe \"terrain\"? That's more specific to geographical features and might include yard, stream, cliff, and maybe even plane if referring to airplane paths? Not sure.\n\n\"Base\" could also work. A base is something you build on the ground (yard), possibly related to Europe's historical bases, snowman built on a base of snow, gold as in treasure hidden at a base, stream nearby, cliff as a part of a mountain range, and plane taking off from a base.\n\nI think \"base\" might be a good fit.

A base could be the foundation of something, like a building's foundation.

But I'm not sure if that fits well. \n\n'Scale' also comes to mind. A scale's base is its stand, which connects the scale to a surface it's measuring.\n\n'Belt' could relate too. Like in a belt-driven system, where belts connect pulleys, maybe acting as a base for mechanical structures.\n\nThere's also 'chair', but I don't see that in this list anymore. It might not be relevant here.\n\nI'm thinking maybe 'plastic' and 'scale' are the best fits because they relate to structural components.\n\nWait, there's also 'hand'.

The words available are: stream, europe, wake, boot, snowman, belt, line, hand, cliff, yard, gold, police, ice, plane, sock, copper, scale.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"base\" means in different contexts.

It could also mean the ground on which something is built or stands. \n\nLooking at the list, words like \"plastic,\" \"scale,\" and \"belt\" were previously considered but removed because they didn't fit as well as expected.

The user wants me to provide one single-word clue that relates to some of these words. They also want the clue and related target words in a specific format.\n\nFirst, I should look at the words again: yard, europe, snowman, gold, stream, cliff. What do these have in common? Let's see:\n\n- \"Yard\" is often associated with fields or parks.\n- \"Europe\" is a continent.\n- \"Snowman\" is something you'd build in the winter.\n- \"Gold\" could relate to precious metals or maybe something like the Golden Gate.\n- \"Stream\" might refer to water streams or even data streams.\n- \"Cliff\" is a type of landform.\n\nHmm, I'm trying to find a word that connects several of these. Let's think about categories they belong to:\n\n1. **Geographical**: Europe, yard (as in a park), stream, cliff.\n2. **Abstract or Conceptual**: Gold is a precious element.\n3. **Figurative or Abstract**: Snowman isn't strictly geographical but is a common winter figure.\n\nSo, looking for a word that can link some of these either through location or concept.\n\n\"Base\" comes to mind. How?\n\n- A \"yard\" has a base where activities happen.\n- \"Europe\" can be considered a continent with various bases (like countries are the bases).\n- \"Stream\" starts at a base, like water flowing from a source.\n- \"Cliff\" has a base (the edge) from which something hangs or drops.\n- \"Gold\" might not fit directly, but metaphorically, gold is a foundation for wealth.\n\nSo, \"base\" seems to relate well with yard, europe, stream, cliff. Maybe also snowman if we consider the snow being on top of a base structure? But I'm not sure about that connection.\n\nLet me make sure none of these words are in the distractors or opponents' lists:\n\n- Distractors remaining: scale, police, boot, copper, ice, hand.\n- Opponents remaining: cell, sock, wake, belt, line.\n\nNone of them is \"base,\" so it's safe. Also, \"base\" isn't a kill word, as per the previous messages.\n\nI think \"base\" is a strong clue that ties together several team words without overlapping with opponent or distractor words.

'Belt' could be like the base of something holding it together, but I'm not certain.\n\nNow, 'line'—could this mean a foundation line for a structure? Or maybe a border? 'Hand' seems too generic or could relate to handling something. 'Cliff' is a big slope, doesn't directly relate. 'Yard' is an area, possibly where a base might be built, like in a garden. 'Gold' is precious metal, not really related. 'Police' is about law enforcement, so no connection. 'Ice' might relate to the foundation of something frozen. 'Copper' is a material, could be used in building materials. 'Scale' can mean weighing or measurement, which doesn't directly tie to 'base'.\n\nHmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe 'line', 'yard', and 'scale' could be associated with a base somehow. Wait, does 'scale' relate? Maybe like measuring the base of something. And 'yard' as an area where a base might be laid out. 'Line' as the foundation line or boundary.\n\nSo putting it all together, I think the words that best relate to 'base' from this list are 'line', 'yard', and 'scale'. Yeah, that seems reasonable.\n"}}], "created": 1748355505, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 474, "prompt_tokens": 625, "total_tokens": 1099, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:18:25.369424", "call_duration": "0:00:23.898189", "response": "GUESS: line, yard, scale", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T16:19:25.502249", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

Let me recap the conversation to make sure I understand the flow.\n\nThe initial list of words for both teams was provided, along with distractors and kill words. The user started by giving a clue \"structure\" related to stadium, plane, chair. Then they mentioned that 'web' was guessed but was innocent, so the turn ended. Next, they provided another clue \"base\" linking several words.\n\nEach time, the user is reducing their own team's list and the opponent's list as well. Now, in the latest query, the word 'line' was guessed but it belongs to the opponent, so the teammate's turn ended. The remaining words are yard, europe, snowman, gold, stream, cliff for the user's team, and wake, belt for the opponent.\n\nThe user needs another clue based on their remaining words. I need to pick a single word that relates semantically to as many of their target words as possible but isn't one of them or containing parts of them.\n\nLooking at the remaining targets: yard, europe, snowman, gold, stream, cliff. Let's see what they have in common. 'Yard' is part of nature or land; 'Europe' is a continent; 'snowman' is seasonal and maybe linked to winter; 'gold' is a precious metal or a color; 'stream' is a body of water; 'cliff' is a natural feature.\n\nThe word that stands out is 'base.' A base can refer to a foundation, which could relate to things like cliffs (as they have bases) and maybe even the stream as part of a watershed. But does it also tie into yard or gold? Not directly, but perhaps through abstract connections.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I use 'base,' how well does it fit each target? 'Yard' could be seen metaphorically as a base for activities, 'Europe' doesn't fit, 'snowman' maybe not, 'gold' is unrelated, 'stream' might relate to water sources which can have bases, and 'cliff' definitely has a base. So it's somewhat fitting but not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a better word? Maybe 'structure' was used before, so I can't repeat that. 'Nature' comes to mind because 'yard,' 'snowman,' 'stream,' and 'cliff' all relate to nature elements. But does 'nature' fit with 'gold'? Not really.\n\nHmm, maybe 'base' is still the best option despite its limited connection. It touches on some targets more directly than others, and it's a single word that can encompass multiple things without being too obscure.\n\nSo I'll go with 'base' again but ensure that the related target words are those it can genuinely link to: yard, stream, cliff. That way, the clue is still valid even if it doesn't perfectly fit all remaining words.\n"}}], "created": 1748355529, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 647, "prompt_tokens": 1143, "total_tokens": 1790, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:18:49.269182", "call_duration": "0:00:36.232718", "response": "CLUE: nature  \nTARGETS: yard, snowman, stream, cliff", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T16:19:52.391293", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'structure'.

Let's start with \"stream.\" Streams are natural bodies of water, so that definitely relates to nature.\n\nNext is \"europe,\" but Europe itself isn't really a nature-related term—it's more of a continent. So maybe not the best fit here.\n\nThen we have \"boot.\" Hmm, boot could refer to footwear or perhaps something like a boot on a computer, but I'm leaning towards the footwear meaning here, which doesn't seem directly related to nature.\n\n\"Snowman\" is next. Snowmen are definitely associated with winter and natural elements, so that's a good one for nature.\n\n\"Belt\" could be tricky. It might refer to something like a belt in clothing or a tool used for logging, but I'm not sure if it's strongly tied to nature.\n\n\"Hand\" seems too generic—people have hands, but it doesn't specifically relate to nature unless you consider things like hand tools or parts of animals, which might be a stretch.\n\n\"Cliff\" is another one that can relate to nature since cliffs are natural formations.\n\n\"Yard\" could go both ways. On one hand, it's an area measurement, but yards can also refer to natural spaces like gardens or parks.\n\n\"Gold\" is interesting. While gold itself isn't inherently part of nature, it's often found in natural settings and used in jewelry made from minerals extracted from the earth.\n\n\"Police\" doesn’t seem to have a direct connection to nature. They're law enforcement officers.\n\n\"Ice\" is definitely a natural element, so that fits well with 'nature.'\n\n\"Copper\" could relate to natural resources, as copper can be found in the Earth's crust and is used for various purposes, but it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nLastly, \"scale\" might refer to something like scales on fish or other organisms, which are part of nature.\n\nAfter going through each word, I think \"stream,\" \"snowman,\" \"cliff,\" \"yard,\" \"gold,\" and \"ice\" stand out as the ones most closely associated with 'nature.' They all have clear connections to natural elements or environments.\n"}}], "created": 1748355565, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 519, "prompt_tokens": 743, "total_tokens": 1262, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 16:19:25.504668", "call_duration": "0:00:26.886444", "response": "GUESS: stream, snowman, cliff, yard, gold, ice", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
