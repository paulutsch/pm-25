You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: mouse, ray, screen, bugle, file, oil, link, post, beijing.\nYour opponent's team words are: horn, stadium, palm, pass, face, olympus, soul, light.\nDistractor words are: eye, police, grace, drill, maple, needle, time.\nThe kill words are: giant."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-9ydcrzsc496ja4omco5a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: Link\nTARGETS: mouse, ray, screen, bugle, file, oil, post, beijing", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nAlright, I'm trying to help my team come up with a good single-word clue that relates to some of our target words while not being obvious or too easy. Let me start by looking at the words we have: mouse, ray, screen, bugle, file, oil, link, post, beijing.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what these words might have in common semantically or through associations. Let's list them out again:\n\n- Mouse\n- Ray\n- Screen\n- Bugle\n- File\n- Oil\n- Link\n- Post\n- Beijing\n\nHmm, some of these words can be associated with technology or gadgets: mouse (computer), screen (monitor or digital display), link (like a URL or computer network link). But then there are words like bugle, file, oil, post, and Beijing which don't fit as well. Bugle makes me think of the bugle, but I'm not sure how that ties in. File could be related to data storage or filing systems. Oil is more about resources. Beijing is a city, so maybe less relevant.\n\nLooking at the opponent's words: horn, stadium, palm, pass, face, olympus, soul, light. They have some that are quite different from ours, but I need to ensure my clue doesn't inadvertently help them by mentioning their words or related ones.\n\nDistractors include eye, police, grace, drill, maple, needle, time. So if my clue can avoid these, it's better. The kill word is giant, so I have to be careful not to hint at that either.\n\nThinking of a single-word clue that ties multiple target words together semantically. Let's see:\n\n- \"Screen\" could relate to mouse and screen, but does it connect to others? Maybe link (as in computer), ray (as in monitor rays?), file (if we think digital files on a screen), bugle might be harder.\n\n- \"Link\" is good because it connects mouse (like a network link) and screen (like a URL link). Ray could be less obvious, but perhaps as in a network connection. File and link make sense together, bugle maybe not as much, but oil? Not really. Post could relate to email or postal service, which might tie into screen if we think of digital post.\n\nWait, another thought: \"Link\" is strong because it directly connects several target words. Mouse and link (computers), ray (as in networking?), screen (displaying links), file (data linked together). Bugle doesn't fit as much, but maybe not a big issue since the goal is to have my partner guess ours, not theirs.\n\nAlternatively, \"File\" could work because it ties to file storage, which is computer-related. Mouse and link can relate to files on a computer. Ray might be less obvious, but maybe in terms of data rays or something. Screen is where files are viewed.\n\nBut considering the other words, \"Link\" seems more versatile. It can connect mouse, screen, link itself, file, even post if we think of email posts linked. It avoids directly connecting to opponent's words like stadium, palm, etc., and doesn't include any distractors or kill words.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards \"Link\" as the clue.\n"}}], "created": 1748365310, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 702, "prompt_tokens": 316, "total_tokens": 1018, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 19:01:50.034498", "call_duration": "0:00:31.721107", "response": "CLUE: Link\nTARGETS: mouse, ray, screen, bugle, file, oil, post, beijing", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
