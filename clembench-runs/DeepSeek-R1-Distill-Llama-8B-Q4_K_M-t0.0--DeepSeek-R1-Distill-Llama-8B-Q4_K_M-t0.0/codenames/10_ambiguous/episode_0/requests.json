You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: page, race, peep, firm, spell, press, toll, grave, flat.\nYour opponent's team words are: vault, sheer, peck, card, liver, rank, jig, gag.\nDistractor words are: pump, scrub, rag, stem, bowl, bull, nip.\nThe kill words are: bank."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-gz38d8rdvtt8z8yu10i0lm", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: flat\nTARGETS: page, press, grave, toll, peep", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words while also potentially being related to opponent words or distractors in a way that helps my partner guess our words before the opponents do. Hmm. Let me start by listing out all the relevant words.\n\nMy team has: page, race, peep, firm, spell, press, toll, grave, flat.\nOpponent's team: vault, sheer, peck, card, liver, rank, jig, gag.\nDistractors: pump, scrub, rag, stem, bowl, bull, nip.\nKill word: bank.\n\nI need a clue word that is semantically related to as many of my team's words as possible but doesn't directly match any of them. Also, it shouldn't be part of the opponent's words or contain parts of them. \n\nLooking at my team's words, I notice several are related to \"flat\" surfaces. For example, page, press, grave, toll can all have a flat aspect. Flat is also in the distractors as flat isn't listed, wait, no, the distractor list includes pump, scrub, rag, stem, bowl, bull, nip—so flat isn't a distractor.\n\nWait, but \"flat\" could be related to several of my team's words: page (can be flat), press (like a flat press), grave (flat ground?), toll (maybe flat road? Not sure), and peep (peeping over something, maybe flat).\n\nSo, using \"flat\" as the clue. Does that relate well?\n\nLet me check opponent's words: they have vault, which is not related to flat. Sheer is a type of fabric, so unrelated. Peck could be a bird's bill or someone's name; no. Card is playing cards? Maybe, but \"card\" isn't related to flat in a direct way. Liver, rank, jig, gag—none seem connected to \"flat.\" So opponent's words don't have any direct connection to \"flat,\" which is good because if my partner guesses an opponent or distractor word, the game ends.\n\nWait, does \"peck\" relate to anything? My team has \"peep,\" but no. Opponent has \"peck,\" which is a different word. So using \"flat\" as clue won't directly cause an end of the game if my partner uses it because it's not an opponent or kill word.\n\nAlso, \"flat\" is related to several of our words: page (like flat pages), press (maybe flat press?), grave (as in flat ground for graves), toll (maybe as a flat toll road?), peep (over something flat). So that's good. It connects to multiple team words without being part of the opponent's list.\n\nSo, I think \"flat\" is a strong clue here because it relates to several of my team's words and doesn't interfere with opponents or end the game if guessed incorrectly.\n"}}], "created": 1748372648, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 633, "prompt_tokens": 314, "total_tokens": 947, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:04:08.594807", "call_duration": "0:00:27.518630", "response": "CLUE: flat\nTARGETS: page, press, grave, toll, peep", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
