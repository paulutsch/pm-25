You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: poop, page, test, shock, steer, mint, bolt, tag, plot.\nYour opponent's team words are: cramp, rib, stall, rack, rag, host, trap, pitch.\nDistractor words are: zip, bust, flat, duck, rank, spill, stable.\nThe kill words are: steep."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-4dn1p26wdyelqxbyxxm1pa", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: print\nTARGETS: page, plot, test", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words from the given list. The goal is for my partner to guess all our team's words before the opponent does, but without giving away any of their or the distractors' words.\n\nOur team's words are: poop, page, test, shock, steer, mint, bolt, tag, plot.\nOpponent's words: cramp, rib, stall, rack, rag, host, trap, pitch.\nDistractors: zip, bust, flat, duck, rank, spill, stable.\nKill word: steep.\n\nFirst, I need to look for semantic connections between my team's words and find a single word that can relate to multiple of them. Let me list out the team's words again: poop, page, test, shock, steer, mint, bolt, tag, plot.\n\nLooking at each word:\n\n- Poop: relates to waste or animals.\n- Page: could relate to a webpage or something you turn.\n- Test: might relate to testing in exams or products.\n- Shock: an electrical term, but also can mean surprise.\n- Steer: like guiding or controlling a direction; also animal.\n- Mint: could be the flavor, but also a plant or currency.\n- Bolt: related to fasteners or movement.\n- Tag: labeling something, or someone's name.\n- Plot: could relate to storytelling or land.\n\nNow, I need a word that connects to multiple of these. Let's think about possible connections:\n\nPoop and bolt might connect if thinking about animal movements, but that seems a stretch. Poop is waste, bolt is fast.\n\nPage can relate to paper or digital pages. Maybe something like 'print' or 'page', but 'print' might be too broad.\n\nTest relates to exams or product testing. So maybe 'examine', but that's two words.\n\nShock could relate to electricity (shock) or surprise. Maybe 'voltage'? But that's more about electricity.\n\nSteer can relate to animals or guiding. So maybe something like 'ox' or 'cow', but those are specific and may not cover others.\n\nMint can be flavor or a plant. Maybe 'fragrance'?\n\nBolt could relate to speed, as in fast bolt, or like lightning (lightning bolt). But that's two words again.\n\nTag relates to labels or identification, maybe 'label' or 'name'.\n\nPlot could be land plotting or storytelling plot. So maybe something like 'map'? No, because that's not directly on our list.\n\nLooking for a word that can tie together multiple meanings without being too obscure. Let me think of words that connect to different team words.\n\nWait, 'plot' relates to land as well as storytelling. So maybe a word related to both? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, 'test' could relate to testing, which is part of R&D, so maybe 'lab' but that's not a single word clue.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can think of 'web', but 'page' relates to web pages. Or 'link', but that might be too vague.\n\nWait, 'host' is an opponent's word and also a distractor? Let me check the distractors: yes, host is there. So I cannot use that because if my partner guesses 'host', it ends their turn and gives the opponent a chance, which I don't want. So 'host' is out.\n\nWhat about 'print'? That relates to 'page' as in printed pages, but also connects with 'test' if you're testing print quality. Also, 'plot' could be part of a story being printed. Maybe that's a stretch, but it covers multiple team words.\n\nAlternatively, 'test' could relate to 'examine', which is two words, but I need one word.\n\nWait, maybe 'print' as the clue because it relates to page and plot (as in plot device), and possibly test if you're testing print quality. That might work. Let me see:\n\nCLUE: print\nTARGETS: page, plot, test\n\nBut is that too much? It needs to relate semantically without being a distractor or opponent word.\n\nLooking back, 'print' isn't in any of the lists except as a distractor? Wait, no, the distractors are zip, bust, flat, duck, rank, spill, stable. So 'print' is not a distractor. Opponent's words don't include 'print', so it's safe.\n\nBut wait, the kill word is steep, which is unrelated, so that's fine.\n\nAnother angle: 'plot' relates to land as well as story, and 'steer' can connect with guiding on land. So maybe a word like 'direction'? But that might be too broad.\n\nAlternatively, 'map', but that's not part of the team words except plot, which is land plotting.\n\nWait, let me think about the team's words again: poop, page, test, shock, steer, mint, bolt, tag, plot. Maybe a word like 'link' because 'page' can link to other pages, 'bolt' as in lightning bolt (linking to electricity and movement), but that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, 'test' can be a test on a webpage ('page'), so maybe 'web'. But 'web' isn't part of the team's words except via 'page'.\n\nHmm, perhaps 'link' is better because it ties together page, bolt (as in lightning), and also tag as in linking tags. But that might not cover all.\n\nWait, 'tag' relates to labels or identification, so maybe 'label', but that's longer.\n\nAlternatively, 'print' seems to be the best fit because it covers page, plot, and test indirectly through quality testing.\n\nSo I'll go with 'print' as the clue, targeting page, plot, and test.\n"}}], "created": 1748372676, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1231, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 1544, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:04:36.124237", "call_duration": "0:00:54.968038", "response": "CLUE: print\nTARGETS: page, plot, test", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T21:05:49.850846", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'print'.

The word 'print' could have multiple meaningsâ€”printing as in printing a document, or printing in the sense of imprinting something. Looking at the provided list: tag, flat, rack, rib, trap, rank, stable, plot, bolt, page, zip, steep, rag, steer, cramp, poop, duck, host, spill, pitch, bust, stall, mint, shock, test.\n\nI should focus on words that are most closely associated with printing. 'Page' immediately comes to mind because pages are a fundamental part of printed materials. Then, 'print' itself is often bound into a book or document, so maybe 'bind' or something similar. Wait, but the list doesn't include 'bind'. Alternatively, 'flat' could be relevant as pages are flat. Hmm.\n\nLooking again, 'host' might relate to hosting content on a page, which ties into printing. But I'm not sure if that's the best fit. Another option is 'plot', but that might not directly tie to printing. 'Pitch' could relate to setting something in print, like a pitch for a story. Not as strong.\n\nWait, perhaps 'rank' or 'stable' don't seem to connect well. 'Tag' could be used for labels on printed items. 'Bolt' doesn't seem relevant. 'Rag' is more about laundry but sometimes used metaphorically. Maybe 'steep', but that's not directly related.\n\nI think 'page' is definitely the top choice. Then, perhaps 'print' itself isn't an option since it's the word we're starting with. Oh wait, 'host' might be a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe 'bind' isn't in the list. So I'll stick with 'page' as the most relevant.\n"}}], "created": 1748372731, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 441, "prompt_tokens": 108, "total_tokens": 549, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:05:31.100907", "call_duration": "0:00:18.749843", "response": "GUESS: page, tag, host", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-27T21:06:14.004037", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

Maybe \"Poop\" is also related to \"test\" in terms of a test result? Not sure about that. Or perhaps \"steer\" could be associated with guiding, which might connect with something else.\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to focus on the most direct relationship first. \"Poop\" and \"bolt\" seem closely linked through the metaphor of speed or urgency. So using \"poop\" as a clue for bolt would help relate that word. But I need to make sure the other targets are correct.\n\nWait, perhaps \"test\" is also related to \"poop.\" Like in the context of a test result not being good (\"poop\" you failed). So maybe \"poop\" can target both \"test\" and \"bolt.\"\n\nLet me check: CLUE: poop TARGETS: bolt, test.\n\nThat seems plausible. The user's partner can then guess these two words, which are part of the team's list. It's a single-word clue but relates to two targets, which is efficient.\n\nI should present this as CLUE: poop with TARGETS: bolt, test. That way, it's concise and ties two words together that might not be obvious at first glance but have a clear connection.\n"}}], "created": 1748372749, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 501, "prompt_tokens": 492, "total_tokens": 993, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:05:49.851779", "call_duration": "0:00:24.150792", "response": "CLUE: poop  \nTARGETS: bolt, test", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
