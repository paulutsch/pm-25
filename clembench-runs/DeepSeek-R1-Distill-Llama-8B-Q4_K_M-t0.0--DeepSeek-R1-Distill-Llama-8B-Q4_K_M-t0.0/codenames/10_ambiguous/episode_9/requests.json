You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: grave, rag, snuff, rear, lap, stem, stall, flag, freak.\nYour opponent's team words are: clip, lean, drill, cuff, hip, spray, rush, tag.\nDistractor words are: pawn, arm, coil, liver, crab, drone, stripe.\nThe kill words are: bark."}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-rk0c3tkzwbiutgzx0enp6l", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nCLUE: flag  \nTARGETS: flag", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best single-word clue for my team based on the given lists. My team's words are grave, rag, snuff, rear, lap, stem, stall, flag, and freak. The opponent has clip, lean, drill, cuff, hip, spray, rush, tag. Distractors include pawn, arm, coil, liver, crab, drone, stripe. Kill word is bark.\n\nFirst, I should analyze each of my team's words to find common semantic themes or connections that could be linked with a single word. Let me go through them one by one:\n\n- Grave: related to death, cemetery.\n- Rag: could be cloth rag or slang for something (e.g., \"rag doll\").\n- Snuff: could refer to tobacco, but also to suffocate someone.\n- Rear: might mean backside, as in \"rear end,\" or the part of a car.\n- Lap: could relate to a lap around something, like a car's lap or racing.\n- Stem: could be the stem of a plant or the stem of an object.\n- Stall: relates to stopping or waiting, like a car stall or horse race stall.\n- Flag: could be a flag in general or a flag as in clothing.\n- Freak: refers to something abnormal or unusual.\n\nLooking for common threads, \"flag\" stands out because it can relate both to the clothing term and the actual flag. \"Rag\" and \"flag\" can both be associated with pieces of cloth used in certain contexts. Additionally, \"lap,\" \"stall,\" \"stem,\" and \"rear\" might not have strong connections to common words outside the list. So focusing on \"flag\" as a clue seems promising because it's semantically connected to several team words.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that \"flag\" isn't one of the opponent's words or distractors. The opponent has \"flag\" listed? Wait, no, their words are clip, lean, drill, cuff, hip, spray, rush, tag. So \"flag\" is unique to my team. Good.\n\nDistractors are pawn, arm, coil, liver, crab, drone, stripe. None of these are \"flag,\" so that's safe. Kill word is bark, which doesn't interfere either.\n\nSo the clue should be \"Flag.\" It relates specifically to one of our words and can potentially link to others through context without being a distractor or kill word.\n"}}], "created": 1748374469, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 518, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 831, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-27 21:34:29.142520", "call_duration": "0:00:23.277773", "response": "CLUE: flag  \nTARGETS: flag", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
