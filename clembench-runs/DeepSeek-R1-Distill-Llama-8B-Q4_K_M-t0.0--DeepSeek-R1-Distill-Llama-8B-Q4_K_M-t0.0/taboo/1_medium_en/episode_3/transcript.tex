	 The target word is "nelson," a last name starting with the letter 'N.' My friend's initial guess of "Newton" fits well since both are last names beginning with 'N.' This approach is effective because it directly relates to the target word while adhering to the rules. \\ \tt \\ \tt Considering the related words "hold," "nell," and "wrestling," they could also provide additional clues without revealing too much information, potentially helping narrow down the guess in future attempts. However, sticking to a clear and concise clue like mentioning the initial letter is sufficient for this stage.\\ \tt \\ \tt In conclusion, guessing "Newton" as a last name starting with 'N' is a strategic choice that aligns well with the target word's characteristics, offering a clear path toward the correct answer while staying within the game's constraints.
