Words like average, usual, everyday come to mind, but those aren't on the list. The related words provided are common (like ordinary), normal, and plain. So I need a description that points towards \"ordinary\" without mentioning it or any of the other related words.\n\nMaybe I can describe something that's not special or unique.
