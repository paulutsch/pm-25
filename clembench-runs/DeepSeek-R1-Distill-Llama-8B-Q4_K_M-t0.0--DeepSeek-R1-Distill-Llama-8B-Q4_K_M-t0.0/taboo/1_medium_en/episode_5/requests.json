Otherwise, I lose if I accidentally give away information.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what a chapel is without mentioning any related words. A chapel is a place where people go for worship or gatherings, usually in a religious context. It's smaller than a church. So maybe I can say it's a building used for religious meetings.\n\nWait, but I shouldn't mention anything directly related to \"praying\" or \"worshipping\". So perhaps focusing on the structure and purpose without the specific activities. Maybe something like a small building where groups gather for spiritual purposes.\n\nBut I have to make sure I don't use any morphological variants either. So no words that are forms of \"chapel\", but related terms might be tricky. Since the related words are given as \"praying\", \"worshipping\", and \"meditation\", I should avoid those too.\n\nSo maybe a simple clue: it's a small building used for religious gatherings or meetings. That doesn't hint at specific activities like worshipping, so it avoids the related words.\n\nAlternatively, another angle could be that it's a place where people come together in a quiet setting for reflection. But again, I have to avoid any terms that might tie back to \"praying\" or similar.\n\nI think the key is to describe its function without referencing the activities associated with it.

So, maybe the target word is CHURCH. That seems to fit perfectly because churches are indeed small (depending on the size) and are used for gatherings and meetings, like weddings, funerals, and regular services.\n\nWait, could it be another word? Let me think if there's anything else. Maybe \"temple\" or \"synagogue,\" but those might be more specific to certain religions. The clue doesn't specify a particular religion, so CHURCH is probably the best guess as it's commonly used across many denominations.\n\nI don't think the answer could be something like \"building\" because that's too general.
