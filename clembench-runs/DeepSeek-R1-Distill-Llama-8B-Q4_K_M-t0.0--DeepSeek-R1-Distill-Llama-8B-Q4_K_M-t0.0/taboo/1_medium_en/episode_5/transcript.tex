	 The target word is "chapel," and the user's guess was "church." \\ \tt \\ \tt - **Understanding the Target Word:** Chapel refers specifically to a smaller building used by religious groups for gatherings and meetings, similar in function to a church but typically smaller.\\ \tt \\ \tt - **User's Guess:** The user guessed "church," which is closely related but more general. While chapel and church are connected, "chapel" is often a specific term referring to a smaller place of worship within or separate from a larger church building.\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Rules and Considerations:**\\ \tt   - **No Use of Target Word or Related Words:** The rules specify that using the target word itself or any related words like "praying," "worshipping," or "meditation" could lead to disqualification. While "church" is related, it's not exactly a synonym for "chapel."\\ \tt   \\ \tt   - **Three Tries Rule:** Since the user made one guess ("church"), they didn't reach the three-tries threshold needed for both players to win.\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Conclusion:** The user's guess of "church" is logical given the context but doesn't meet the criteria for a successful game end. To avoid disqualification, further clues or guesses would need to align more closely with "chapel" without referencing its related terms.
