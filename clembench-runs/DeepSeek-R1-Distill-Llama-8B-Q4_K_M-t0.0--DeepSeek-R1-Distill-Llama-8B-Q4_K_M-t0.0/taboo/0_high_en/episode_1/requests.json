It usually refers to something that doesn't depend on others for support or needs. So maybe I can start by talking about someone who doesn't rely on others. But how do I phrase that without using the word itself?\n\nI should consider synonyms or related terms but avoid the exact words given. Maybe \"self-reliant\" is a good alternative since it's similar to independent, but wait, is \"self-reliant\" one of the forbidden words? Let me check: no, the only related words are autarkical, strong-minded, and separate, so self-reliant is okay.\n\nAlternatively, I could describe their behavior. Maybe something like \"doesn't require help often\" or \"makes their own decisions.\" But that might be too vague. The user wants clues to be concise but effective.\n\nLet me think about the root meaning again. An independent person stands on their own two feet, isn't controlled by others. So perhaps I can say something like \"Someone who stands alone without needing others' support.\"\n\nWait, let's break it down more. Maybe focus on the aspect of making decisions without external influence. So a clue could be about making choices not influenced by others.\n\nAnother angle: independent people often set their own goals and don't follow others'. So maybe a clue like \"sets personal goals instead of following others' paths.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure it's clear enough for the player to guess in three tries. Maybe two clues would be better, but since the user mentioned only one is needed initially, perhaps two concise clues.\n\nWait, the initial prompt from the user says to give a single clue. So I should focus on one strong clue that points towards independence without using forbidden terms.\n\nHow about \"Someone who doesn't rely on others for their well-being\"? That captures the essence of independence without mentioning the exact word. It suggests self-sufficiency and lack of dependence.\n\nAlternatively, \"One who makes decisions without needing advice from others.\" That also highlights independence in decision-making.\n\nI think either of these would work as a clue. They both describe the characteristic without using any forbidden terms or the target word.\n"}}], "created": 1748421017, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 551, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 749, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 10:30:17.306386", "call_duration": "0:00:23.922495", "response": "CLUE: Someone who doesn't rely on others for their well-being.  \n\nThis clue describes the independence aspect by highlighting self-sufficiency and lack of reliance on others.", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}]
