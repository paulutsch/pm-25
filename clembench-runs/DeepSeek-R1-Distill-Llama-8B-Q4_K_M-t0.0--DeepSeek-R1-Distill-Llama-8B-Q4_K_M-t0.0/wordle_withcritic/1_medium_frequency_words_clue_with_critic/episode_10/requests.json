You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

The word should have five letters, as it's a standard Wordle requirement. Next, \"jelly\" is part of the clue, so I'm thinking maybe the target word has \"jelly\" in it or is associated with something gelatinous. Finally, \"source\" suggests that perhaps the word is something that comes from fruits or is a source related to them.\n\nConsidering possible five-letter words related to fruits and jelly, one that comes to mind is \"grapefruit,\" but that's seven letters. Another possibility might be \"mango,\" which is five letters, but it doesn't directly include \"jelly.\" Wait, maybe \"gelatin\" is a stretch, but that's seven letters as well.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think of a word that combines fruits and jelly in a more compact way. The word \"berry\" is five letters but doesn't connect to jelly directly. Maybe something like \"concoction,\" but that's too long.\n\nWait, the clue says \"fruit jelly source.\" So maybe the word is something like \"jelly,\" but it needs to be a source or related to fruits. Alternatively, could it be \"mango\"? Or perhaps \"apple.\" Wait, \"apple\" doesn't seem to fit as well because it's not directly connected to jelly.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe \"source\" implies that the word is a type of fruit that's a source for something like a dessert. So could it be \"grape\"? No, that's four letters. Or maybe \"mango,\" but I'm still not sure about the connection to jelly.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps \"jellyfish\" is too long, and besides, it's an animal, not a fruit. Alternatively, \"gelly\" as in gelatin is another term, but again, not directly a fruit source.\n\nLet me think differently. The clue might be indicating that the word is something like a jelly-like substance made from fruits, such as \"jelly,\" but that's only four letters. Or maybe \"mousse\"? No, that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps \"fruit\" itself could be part of the word, and it relates to jelly in some way. For example, \"fruitage\" is too long. Maybe \"berry.\" Hmm, not quite connecting to jelly.\n\nI might need to consider that \"jelly source\" refers to something like \"pectin,\" but that's five letters and related to jams, not necessarily a fruit itself. Alternatively, \"concoct\" is another word for make, but that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, perhaps the word is \"mango,\" as in mango jelly? That could work, but I'm not sure if \"mango\" is considered a source directly. Alternatively, maybe it's \"apricot,\" which is a fruit and might be used to make jams or jellies.\n\nBut wait, the clue specifically says \"fruit jelly source.\" So perhaps the word is \"jelly,\" but that doesn't connect to being a source of fruit. Alternatively, maybe \"source\" as in the origin of jelly from fruits.\n\nI'm going in circles here. Maybe I should think of possible five-letter words related to fruits and jelly. Another possibility could be \"marmalade,\" which is a fruit preserve, but that's seven letters. No, too long.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"gelly,\" but that's four letters. Or maybe \"jello,\" which is a type of gelatin dessert, but that's five letters. So \"jello\" could be the word because it directly relates to jelly and might imply a source from fruits.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, considering all these thoughts, I think the target word is probably \"jello.\"\n"}}], "created": 1748449158, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 851, "prompt_tokens": 357, "total_tokens": 1208, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}]
