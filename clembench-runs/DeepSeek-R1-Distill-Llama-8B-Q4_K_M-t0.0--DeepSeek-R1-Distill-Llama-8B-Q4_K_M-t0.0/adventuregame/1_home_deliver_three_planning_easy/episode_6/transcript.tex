	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Write your plan for your next actions on the line below your action, starting with "Next actions:".\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt Next actions: take orange, eat orange\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the pillow on the table, the book on the table and the plate on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a kitchen now. There are a counter, a cupboard and a plate. The cupboard is closed. The plate is on the counter. There are passages to a pantry, a living room and a hallway here.
