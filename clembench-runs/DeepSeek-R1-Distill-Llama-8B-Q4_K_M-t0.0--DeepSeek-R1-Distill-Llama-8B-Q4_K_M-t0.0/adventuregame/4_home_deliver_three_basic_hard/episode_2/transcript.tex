There are a mop and a broom. The mop is on the floor. The broom is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 To proceed in the text adventure game, considering the information provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Understanding the Goal**: The objective is to place a banana in the freezer, a book on the side table, and a plate on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Current Location**: You are in a broom closet with a mop and a broom on the floor, along with a passage leading into a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Action Needed**: Since "through passage" likely means entering another area, the logical step is to go through the passage into the hallway to explore further locations where you might find or use items relevant to your goal.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Going Through the Passage**: The action "go through passage" implies moving from the broom closet into a hallway. This will likely reveal new areas, possibly containing the necessary items (banana, book, plate) or providing access to their locations.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Exploring the Hallway**: Upon entering the hallway, you might find additional rooms, objects, or other passages that aid in achieving your goals. For instance, exploring different rooms could lead to a freezer where the banana can be placed.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Interacting with Objects**: Once in the appropriate areas (like the freezer), you'll have opportunities to take actions such as picking up items ("get banana") or moving them to required locations.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Achieving the Goal**: By strategically using the items found and placing them correctly, you can fulfill your objective: placing the banana in the freezer, the book on the side table, and the plate on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt **Final Action:**\\ \tt \\ \tt > go through passage
