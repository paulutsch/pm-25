Let me see what's going on. The goal is to put the apple in the cupboard, the book in the wardrobe, and the broom in the freezer. Right now, I'm in the pantry, and there are two closed freezers and a passage to the kitchen.\n\nHmm, so the first thing I notice is that there are two freezers here. Maybe one of them has something important inside? Or perhaps they both have different things. Wait, the passage leads to the kitchen. The kitchen might have more items or other rooms I can explore.\n\nI think my first action should be to check what's in these freezers because that could hold the broom, which needs to be put there. So if I open one freezer, maybe it has the broom inside. Let me try opening the left freezer first.\n\nIf opening the left freezer gives me the broom, then I can pick it up and put it into the other freezer (maybe the right one is closed, but perhaps after picking it up, I can move it). Alternatively, if both freezers are empty or have different things, maybe I need to explore the kitchen for more clues.\n\nWait, another thought: do I already have any objects? The initial description doesn't mention any, so probably not. So my action is to open a freezer.

Hmm, looking back at my previous message, I had described the pantry as having a refrigerator and a freezer, both closed. I mentioned there's a passage to the kitchen. So the user is probably confused about the directions.\n\nI think the issue here is that I used terms like \"left\" and \"right,\" which might not be clear in their current context. Since it's a text-based game, they might not have visual cues to know left from right. Maybe they're wondering how to differentiate between the two freezers or if there's only one freezer.\n\nI should clarify by referring to the positions more precisely. I'll mention using 'left' and 'right' as directions relative to the passage leading to the kitchen. That way, they understand the spatial layout better. Also, explaining that each freezer is a separate object will help them figure out which actions are possible next.\n\nIncluding possible actions like opening or moving objects makes sense because it guides their next steps without assuming prior knowledge.
