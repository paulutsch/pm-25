In text-based games like this, \"left\" and \"right\" refer to directions relative to your current location. Since you are in the **pantry**, \"left\" and \"right\" would be based on which side the passage to the kitchen is on.\n\nSo, if you're standing in the pantry:\n- The passage to the kitchen might be either your left or right.\n- The refrigerator and freezer could also be positioned left and right of the passage (or one could be behind you).\n\nSince I didn't specify exactly where the freezers are located relative to the passage, you'll need to decide which direction to go based on the context.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume:\n- You are facing the passage to the kitchen.\n- The freezers are positioned left and right of the passage.\n\nIf that's the case, \"left freezer\" would mean the one to your **right** if you're facing the passage, or the one on the **south side** (depending on how we define directions). But this can vary based on how you interpret it!\n\nLet me try to clarify:\n> open left freezer\n\nThis means you are choosing a specific direction (\"left\") relative to your current location in the pantry. If \"left\" corresponds to one of the freezers, that action makes sense.\n\nIf you want to explore further:\n1. Open the left or right freezer.\n2. Take the broom from one of the freezers.\n3. Move the broom to another location (like the other freezer).\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify further!", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T15:44:16.125038", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Round: 1"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T15:44:16.125114", "action": {"type": "invalid_format", "content": "command_tag_missing"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-27T15:44:16.125135", "action": {"type": "game_result", "content": {"goal_states_achieved": [], "game_successfully_finished": false}}}]], "adventure_info": {"variant": "plan", "max_turns": 50, "optimal_turns": 22, "goal_count": 3}}
