	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the book on the table, the plate on the table and the mop on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a wardrobe, a bed and a pillow. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.
