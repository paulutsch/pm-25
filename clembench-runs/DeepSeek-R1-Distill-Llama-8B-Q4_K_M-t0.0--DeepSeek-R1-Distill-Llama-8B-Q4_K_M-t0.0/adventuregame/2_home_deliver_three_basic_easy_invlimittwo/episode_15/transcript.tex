	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a chair, a side table, a couch, a shelf and a book. The book is on the side table. There are passages to a hallway, a kitchen and a bedroom here.
