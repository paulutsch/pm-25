Right now, I'm in a pantry. The description says there's a refrigerator and a freezer, both closed, and a passage to the kitchen. My inventory can hold up to two objects at once.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where these items are. The user mentioned that I should start by opening something. Maybe I can open one of the closed doors? But wait, they're both refrigerators and freezers, so maybe the doors aren't accessible yet. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get into the kitchen through the passage.\n\nI think my first action should be to go into the kitchen because that might lead me closer to finding the items I need. So the action would be > open passage. That makes sense because opening the passage could allow me to access more areas where the book, plate, and mop might be located. Alternatively, if there's a door in the pantry, but the user says the passage is here, so probably the passage leads to the kitchen.\n\nWait, maybe I should check what's in the pantry first. Are there any objects or doors that I can interact with besides the passage? The description only mentions the refrigerator, freezer, and the passage, so perhaps my options are limited to those.
