To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit each room once, decide on the direction, and stop when there are no more new rooms to explore.\n\nFirst, I'm in the Mudroom. The available directions are east. So my first move must be east into another room. Let's choose \"GO: east\" because that's the only option here.\n\nNow, moving east from the Mudroom takes me into the Garage. From the Garage, I need to check the available directions. Wait, what are the available directions in the Garage? The initial prompt didn't specify, so maybe I have to assume or figure it out based on the example. In the given example, each room has certain exits that become available when you enter them.\n\nAssuming the Garage allows movement in some directions, perhaps north, south, east, west. But without knowing exact exits, I might need to proceed carefully. Let me think: after entering the Garage, what's next?\n\nOnce in the Garage, maybe I can go north, as that's a common direction. So from Garage, going north would take me into another room, perhaps the Living Room or Den.\n\nAssuming that leads me to, say, the Living Room. Then, from there, available directions might be different. Let's say in the Living Room, I have options like south, east, west. Going south could take me into the Bathroom. Then, from the Bathroom, maybe moving east or north isn't possible, but perhaps south again, leading back to another area.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing without knowing all the room connections. But the main point is to visit as few rooms as possible by making sure each move opens up new areas.\n\nAlternatively, after the Mudroom -> Garage, maybe I can choose directions that lead into unvisited rooms systematically, ensuring minimal changes.\n\nBut since I don't have complete info, I'll follow a logical path based on typical room connections. So next steps would be:\n\nMudroom → East to Garage. Then from Garage, perhaps north into another area. Let's say the Garage allows north, so GO: north. Then check what's available there.\n\nWait, maybe in the Garage, going north leads back to Mudroom or elsewhere. It might loop, but since I need to explore new rooms, I have to be cautious not to revisit until necessary.\n\nAlternatively, after entering the Garage, perhaps south is possible, leading into another room like a Storage Closet or something else.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled without knowing the exact layout. Perhaps it's better to follow the initial steps as per the example: Mudroom → East to Garage. Then from Garage, check directions and proceed accordingly, ensuring that each move opens new rooms until no more are available.\n\nI think I need to list out possible moves step by step based on typical house layouts.\n"}}], "created": 1748428318, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 763, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 992, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:31:58.983153", "call_duration": "0:00:32.386403", "response": "To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].
