Each room I enter, I have to decide which direction to go in, and if there are no new rooms left to visit, I just answer \"DONE\". \n\nStarting point is the Home gym. From here, the available directions are south and west. Hmm, where should I go first? Well, maybe it's best to explore both directions eventually, but let me start with one.\n\nI think going west first might make sense because sometimes starting with a direction can open up more possibilities. So I'll choose \"GO: west\". That takes me into the next room. Now, what's the new available directions? Let's see, in the Home gym, south and west were options, but now in the new room... Wait, I should track each move properly.\n\nSo after going west from the Home gym, let's say that leads me to a Living room. In the Living room, what are the available directions? Maybe east or north, depending on where I came from. But since I just came from west (Home gym), perhaps east is now available here. So in the Living room, my options might be east and north.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The Home gym has south and west as exits. If I go west to the Living room, then from there, maybe east or north could be new directions. But actually, each room's available directions depend on its own layout. Hmm, perhaps in the Living room, I can either go north or south, but not necessarily. Maybe it depends on where the other rooms are connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps going west first isn't the best idea because maybe going south could lead me somewhere more important first. Let me reconsider. Maybe starting with south is better because sometimes that leads to a central area.\n\nSo if I choose \"GO: south\", from Home gym, then I would enter another room, let's say the Den. In the Den, what directions are available? Maybe north or west, but again, it depends on how the rooms are connected.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this systematically. Each time I move into a new room, I have to list out all possible directions that aren't already blocked by walls or something. But since the problem doesn't mention walls, I guess any direction that's available is accessible as long as it's a neighboring room.\n\nSo from Home gym: south and west are open. Let me go north first? No, because \"north\" isn't listed as an option in the initial step. Wait, no, the directions are south and west. So north might not be available yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's just choose one direction first, say west. So the next command would be GO: west. Then I enter a new room, say the Living room. From there, what's available? Maybe east or north, but depending on where that leads.\n\nBut to minimize room changes, maybe I should explore each direction as much as possible before switching. So after going west, I can explore south or another direction in the Living room. But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is a depth-first search, where I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But since we don't have to backtrack (can't move east if I went west first), maybe that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, actually, each room can be thought of as nodes in a graph, and directions as edges leading to other nodes. The goal is to traverse all reachable rooms with the fewest changes, which would correspond to an Eulerian path or something similar, but since we don't know the connections, maybe it's just about choosing directions that allow us to cover the most rooms without unnecessary backtracking.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's simply a matter of exploring each possible direction in the current room until there are no new rooms left. So starting from Home gym: south and west.\n\nSo first, go west. Then in that next room, see what directions are available. If from there, I can go east or north, but not necessarily. Maybe it's better to alternate directions to cover more paths without missing any rooms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best strategy is to always choose a direction that leads to an unvisited room. But since each move only takes you in one direction, and each room may have multiple exits, we need to track which directions have been used to minimize backtracking.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if backtracking is allowed here because the problem doesn't mention being able to go back through a previous room's exit. So once I leave a room, maybe those exits are no longer available unless they lead to new rooms again.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just proceed step by step, choosing directions that haven't been used yet in each room.\n\nBut since the problem gives me the initial available directions for each room, I can follow that. So from Home gym: south and west first. Let's pick one, say west. Then in the next room, whatever directions are available there, perhaps leading to more rooms.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact layout of the rooms beyond the initial ones, it's hard to know where each direction leads. So maybe the best approach is to choose a direction that hasn't been used yet and proceed as far as possible in that direction before changing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choosing directions that lead to more unvisited rooms first. But without knowing how many rooms there are or their connections, it's tricky.\n\nMaybe I should just start by going west from the Home gym. So \"GO: west\". Then, in the next room, see what directions are available. Maybe in that new room, I can go further south or east, depending on what's possible.\n\nBut since the problem is about minimizing changes, perhaps it's better to explore each direction thoroughly before switching, but since each move takes you to a new room, maybe just follow a path until no more new rooms are found.\n\nWait, actually, once all directions in a room have been exhausted, meaning that from there, going in any available direction doesn't take you anywhere new (i.e., leads to a room you've already been in), then you can stop. But the problem states that once there are no new rooms to visit, you stop.\n\nSo perhaps the process is: in each room, try all possible directions until you can't find a new one. So from Home gym: west and south.\n\nFirst, choose west. Then in that new room, check its available directions. If it has more, go there; if not, then return to the original room, but wait, no, we don't have to backtrack. Or do we? The problem doesn't specify whether you can revisit rooms through different exits once you've left them.\n\nWait, but the example given shows that after moving west from Kitchen to Lobby, then north to Bedroom, and then south again, leading to nowhere new. So in the example, after entering the Bedroom with only south available, the next step is DONE.\n\nSo perhaps once all directions have been tried from a room and no new rooms are found, you stop. But I'm not sure if you can revisit previous rooms through other exits unless they lead to new rooms again.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the optimal strategy is to explore as much as possible in one direction before moving on, but without knowing the layout, it's hard to know.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each move takes you from one room to another, and each room's available directions are fixed. So if you have a choice between two directions, perhaps choosing one that hasn't been used in a while or leads to more rooms would be better.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, I think the best approach is to proceed step by step, choosing directions as they become available, and stop when no new rooms are left.\n\nSo, starting from Home gym: south and west. Let me choose west first: \"GO: west\". Now in that room, say the Living room, what's available? Maybe east or north. Let me go east next: \"GO: east\". Then in that room, perhaps there's another direction, maybe south or west. If I go south again, back to Home gym? But then I might be stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in each room, the directions are to other unique rooms, so once you've gone through all possible directions from a room without repeating, you can move on.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to just pick one direction and keep going as far as possible. So after Home gym: west to Living room. Then in Living room: maybe east or south. Let's say east again leads somewhere else, but perhaps not a new room. If that's the case, then after exploring all directions from each room without finding new ones, I can stop.\n\nAlternatively, if going south from Living room takes me back to Home gym, which might have already been visited. So maybe in such cases, I need to keep track of where I've been and not revisit rooms unless necessary.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether revisiting rooms is allowed or not. It just says to stop when there are no new rooms left to visit.\n\nSo perhaps it's safer to explore all directions in each room until no new rooms can be found, then move on to other rooms.\n\nWait, but once I leave a room, do the directions in that room become unavailable unless I revisit it through another path? For example, in the Kitchen example, after leaving south to Lobby, then north to Bedroom, and then south again leads nowhere new. So perhaps the available directions from a previous room can be revisited if they lead to different rooms.\n\nBut this might complicate things as we'd have to track which exits have been used and whether they lead back or forward.\n\nIn any case, given that the problem asks for the fewest number of changes, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose a direction in each room that leads to an unexplored room whenever possible, until all rooms are visited.\n\nSo starting from Home gym: south and west. Let's pick west first: \"GO: west\".\n\nNow, in the new room (Living room), what directions are available? Suppose it has east and north. Maybe I can explore east next: \"GO: east\".\n\nIn that room, perhaps I have more directions, like south or west. If going south takes me to a new room, say Den: \"GO: south\". Now in the Den, what's available? Maybe north or west.\n\nIf I go west from Den, it might take me back to Living room, which I've already been in. So perhaps not useful. Instead, maybe going north is better: \"GO: north\".\n\nIn that new room (maybe an Office), directions available could be south or east. Let's try south: \"GO: south\" to another room.\n\nIf that leads me back to a previous room, like Home gym, then I might need to stop because there are no new rooms left. But if it takes me somewhere else, then I can continue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've covered all possible directions and rooms by now, so the next step would be DONE.\n\nThis process is quite involved without knowing the exact layout of each room, but perhaps the goal is just to alternate directions as much as possible in each room until no new rooms are found.\n\nIn summary, my approach would be:\n\n1. From current room, choose a direction that hasn't been used yet or leads to an unvisited room.\n2. Move accordingly.\n3. Repeat until all possible moves from the current room lead to already visited rooms.\n\nSo applying this to the initial step: Home gym has south and west. Let's pick west first.\n\nNext command: GO: west\n"}}], "created": 1748428409, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2457, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 2688, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:33:29.079314", "call_duration": "0:01:55.436511", "response": "GO: west", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:35:24.516439", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"role": "user", "content": "GO: west"}, "raw_response_obj": {"clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:35:24.516342", "call_duration": "0:00:00.000074", "response": "You have made a step and entered Bathroom.

I just moved from the Home gym into the Bathroom. The available directions now are south and east.\n\nFirst, let me recap where I was before. In the Home gym, I had two options: south and west. I went west and ended up in the Bathroom. Now, in this new room, the directions available are south and east.\n\nWait a minute, how does that happen? So when I was in the Home gym, going west took me to the Bathroom, but now that I'm here, my options have changed to south and east. That suggests that from the Bathroom, moving south or east will take me somewhere new. Maybe those directions lead to different rooms like maybe a Toilet or something else?\n\nBut I need to remember the goal is to explore as few rooms as possible with the least number of changes. So ideally, I should choose a direction that hasn't been explored yet or leads me to unvisited rooms.\n\nLooking at my available directions: south and east. Since I just came from west, going back west might not be useful unless I need to backtrack, which isn't ideal. But I don't know if I can go north again because the Home gym is probably above me now that I'm in the Bathroom.\n\nWait, maybe moving south will take me somewhere new. Let me assume that moving south from the Bathroom leads me to a Toilet or another bathroom-related room like a Shower or something. That seems plausible. On the other hand, moving east could lead me further into the house, perhaps into an Office or another area.\n\nI need to choose between these two directions. Since both are new and available, I should probably go with one based on some logic. Maybe south is a safer bet since it's often towards more common areas in houses, but honestly, without knowing the exact layout, it's a bit of a guess.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something else to consider. If I choose south and then find myself in a Toilet room, will that be the end? Or will there be further rooms to explore? Alternatively, moving east could potentially lead me into an area that has more rooms or different features.\n\nI think it's important not to get stuck in a loop. The goal is to visit all rooms with minimal changes, so I should plan a path that allows me to cover as many unique areas as possible without backtracking unless necessary.\n\nMaybe I should try moving south first because that direction was available when I was in the Home gym and west took me here. Going east might have been another option when I was there, but perhaps it's better to explore different directions systematically.\n\nAlternatively, since both south and east are available now, I could choose either one. If I pick one and then realize I'm stuck or not exploring efficiently, I can switch directions later on.\n\nBut in terms of the immediate next step, I think going south is a reasonable choice because it's often a direction that can lead to different levels or sections within a house layout.\n\nWait, but considering that moving west brought me into the Bathroom, maybe there are other rooms accessible from here. Perhaps east leads back towards the Home gym, but I might have already been there. Alternatively, going east could take me to a new room like an Office or a Den.\n\nI'm a bit confused about whether moving south or east would lead to more exploration opportunities. Without knowing the exact map, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider which direction has fewer possibilities or leads to dead ends. If moving south leads to another room that allows further exploration, whereas moving east might loop back or not provide new rooms, then perhaps south is better.\n\nAlternatively, if both directions lead to new rooms, maybe it doesn't matter which one I choose next because the goal is to explore all rooms regardless of direction. But since I want to minimize the number of room changes, I should pick a direction that logically allows me to visit as many unique rooms as possible with fewer moves.\n\nWait, but in reality, each move only takes me from one room to another, so the number of directions doesn't directly affect how many times I change rooms. Each time I use \"GO: direction,\" it's considered a step into a new room or back to an old one.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm visiting all possible rooms without getting stuck in a loop or missing any rooms because I chose a single direction too early on.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to pick one direction and stick with it until I can't go further, then backtrack if necessary. But since I have both south and east available, maybe I should explore them both systematically.\n\nHowever, that might require more steps than just choosing one. So for now, I'll opt to move south first because it seems like a logical next step, assuming that the Bathroom has rooms in that direction.\n\nSo, my next command would be \"GO: south\" to explore further and see where that leads me.\n"}}], "created": 1748428524, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1018, "prompt_tokens": 260, "total_tokens": 1278, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:35:24.516550", "call_duration": "0:00:44.023001", "response": "GO: south", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:36:08.540294", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"role": "user", "content": "GO: south"}, "raw_response_obj": {"clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:36:08.540130", "call_duration": "0:00:00.000126", "response": "You have made a step and entered Sunroom.

The assistant told me that currently, the available directions are south, north, and west. My goal is to explore all the rooms with as few room changes as possible. Hmm, where should I go first?\n\nWell, the Studio has three exits: South, North, and West. I need to figure out which direction leads me to new rooms that I haven't visited yet. Starting in a new place can be confusing, but maybe going west first makes sense because sometimes exploring further into a building might reveal more secrets.\n\nWait, but where does each direction lead? Going south from the Studio—does that take me somewhere else important? North, on the other hand, might loop me around or take me to another area I haven't been yet. West seems like it could be a different path altogether.\n\nI guess I should start with one of them. Maybe west first because it's an available option and I don't know where that leads yet. If I go west from the Studio, maybe I'll find something interesting or at least move me closer to exploring all rooms without too many changes.\n\nBut hold on, is there any risk in choosing a direction that might take me back to a previous room? I don't want to loop around and end up revisiting places unnecessarily. The goal is to minimize room changes, so I should aim for directions that lead me to new rooms each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps going north first would be better since it's another available option. Maybe the northern direction from Studio leads to a part of the building I haven't explored yet. North often represents an upper level or something in many buildings, so that could be worth checking out.\n\nThen again, south might take me down towards the ground floor or a different wing of the building. Depending on the layout of the building, each direction might lead me to unique rooms. Since all three directions are available, I need to pick one that's likely to give me new experiences without causing loops or revisits.\n\nMaybe I should consider what's been visited before and where this Studio is located in the building. If I'm starting from the Studio, going south could be exiting towards an adjacent room in the same wing, while north might take me up a level to a different area entirely.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact layout of the building, it's hard to say which direction will lead to new rooms. The best strategy might be to try each available direction one by one and see where each path leads.

The goal is to visit all the rooms without changing direction too often unless necessary.\n\nI just entered the Sunroom from the Studio, and now I have two available directions: east and north. My task is to decide which direction to go next. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what each direction might lead me to. If I go east from the Sunroom, where would that take me? Maybe another room or a hallway, but I'm not sure. Going north could also lead me to a different part of the building. Since I just came from the Studio and want to minimize changes, maybe going back the way I came isn't ideal unless there's no other option.\n\nWait, but going back would mean changing direction, which we're supposed to avoid as much as possible. So, if east is an option that leads somewhere new without a lot of backtracking, that might be better. On the other hand, going north could also explore a different area without needing to change direction frequently.\n\nI should probably choose the direction that offers more unexplored areas or fewer changes overall. Without knowing exactly where each direction leads, I have to make an informed guess based on the current state.\n\nChoosing east might take me further into the building, possibly to another room like a Conservatory or Patio, which I haven't visited yet. Going north could lead me towards other rooms like an Office or Library. Since both directions are new and potentially lead to different areas without requiring immediate backtracking, either choice seems acceptable in terms of minimizing changes.\n\nHowever, if the primary objective is to cover as much ground as possible without unnecessary changes, maybe sticking with the direction that allows for more continuous exploration without having to switch too often would be better. But since I only have two choices here, east or north, neither is inherently better than the other based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose one of them, say east, and proceed in that direction.\n"}}], "created": 1748428602, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 429, "prompt_tokens": 351, "total_tokens": 780, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:36:42.349310", "call_duration": "0:00:18.180840", "response": "GO: east", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:37:00.530945", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"role": "user", "content": "GO: east"}, "raw_response_obj": {"clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:37:00.530787", "call_duration": "0:00:00.000121", "response": "You have made a step and entered Studio.

The user has been guiding me through each step, and now I've arrived at the Cellar. Currently, my available directions are east and north. I need to decide which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, let's recap where I am. I'm in the Cellar, and from here, I can go either east or north. The goal is to explore all rooms with as few changes as possible. So, I want to choose a direction that leads me to new rooms without getting stuck too soon.\n\nLooking back at previous moves, whenever there were multiple options, the user chose one direction each time, so maybe following that pattern makes sense here. If I go east first, what happens? Or if I go north instead?\n\nI should consider whether both directions lead to unvisited rooms or if one leads somewhere while the other doesn't. Since the problem statement says there's no new room left once we can't explore further, maybe choosing either direction is fine as long as it's a path that allows me to see all possible rooms.\n\nWait, but perhaps east and north might lead into different areas of the house that haven't been visited yet. To make sure I don't miss any rooms, maybe I should try both directions. But since each step requires choosing only one direction, I need to decide which one is next.\n\nI think going north first might be a good idea because sometimes starting by heading upwards can reveal more rooms in different parts of the house compared to moving east. Alternatively, maybe there's some logic to the room layout that would make either choice optimal. However, without knowing the exact structure of the house, I have to rely on making an informed guess.\n\nBut the user hasn't specified any particular strategy beyond minimizing changes and exploring all rooms. So perhaps any direction that leads me to a new room is acceptable at this point. Given that east and north are both available, choosing either one should work unless there's some implicit rule about preferring certain directions first, like always going west or south unless necessary.\n\nIn the previous interactions, the user sometimes went in one direction and then another, but since each move requires selecting a single direction, I have to pick one. To avoid getting stuck too early, maybe choosing the direction that has more available options is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to consider if either east or north leads to dead ends or more rooms. Since both are possible, and without knowing which is better, it might be arbitrary. However, since I'm in the Cellar, moving north might lead me into a lower level area, while moving east could take me towards a different part of the house.\n\nI think I'll go with going east first because sometimes exploring horizontally can reveal adjacent rooms that might have more options. But honestly, it's a bit of a toss-up without knowing the exact layout. Maybe starting with north is better for moving upwards to other areas.\n\nWait, in some game designs, moving north could lead you through different floors or levels, but I don't know if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps east leads to more interconnected rooms. It's hard to tell, but since both directions are viable, maybe picking one at random is acceptable.\n\nBut the user wants the fewest number of changes possible, so as long as I choose a direction that allows me to explore all rooms without getting stuck quickly, either choice should be fine.

The available directions are west and north. My goal is to explore as many rooms as possible with the fewest changes, which means I need to plan a path that covers all new rooms without getting stuck before that.\n\nFirst off, since I can go either west or north from here, I need to decide between those two directions. If I choose west first, I might end up in a room that allows me more paths, and if I choose north first, it could open another set of doors. But how do I know which one is better? Maybe both will lead to similar outcomes, so perhaps trying each direction can help me explore more rooms.\n\nLet's consider going west. If I go west from the Living room, where would that take me? The user hasn't mentioned what's west yet, but assuming it could be a different room like an Office or maybe another Living room. If I go west and then back east (since in some cases you might loop around), that could cover more rooms.\n\nOn the other hand, going north from the Living room might take me to a Den or another area with different exits. But without knowing exactly where each direction leads, it's tricky to plan the optimal path.\n\nMaybe I should start by exploring one direction first and see what comes next. Let's pick west as the initial move because it feels like a common first exploration choice in many games or puzzles.\n\nAfter moving west, I might enter another room with its own available directions. If that room has more options, I can continue from there. Alternatively, if going north is more promising, I could switch my path after that.\n\nIt's important to note that the goal is to minimize the number of room changes, so ideally, each move should open up new areas without leading back to already visited rooms unless necessary.\n\nSo, for now, moving west seems like a good starting point. If that path doesn't lead to further exploration, then I can try going north instead or even consider if both directions are needed to cover all possible rooms.\n\nWait, but how do I know when there are no new rooms left? That's another consideration. There might come a point where moving in any direction either loops back or doesn't introduce a new room. At that point, I should recognize it and decide to stop, answering with \"DONE.\"\n\nBut until then, I need to systematically explore each available direction in the hopes of discovering new rooms. It would be like a tree where each node is a room, and each edge is a possible direction. My goal is to traverse this tree as efficiently as possible.\n\nIn summary, my plan is:\n\n1. Choose a direction (west first) and move there.\n2. In the new room, check available directions again.\n3. Repeat step 1 for any new rooms encountered.\n4. If moving in any direction doesn't yield new rooms, stop exploring.\n\nThis method should help me visit as many rooms as possible with minimal changes and recognize when no new rooms are left to explore.\n"}}], "created": 1748428693, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 625, "prompt_tokens": 501, "total_tokens": 1126, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:38:13.680601", "call_duration": "0:00:27.212979", "response": "GO: west", "model_name": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-Q4_K_M"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:38:40.894206", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"role": "user", "content": "GO: west"}, "raw_response_obj": {"clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 12:38:40.894087", "call_duration": "0:00:00.000095", "response": "You have made a step and entered Cellar.

From there, I can go south or west. If I choose west first, I enter the Studio. Then from the Studio, I have directions south, north, and west.

From Studio, if I go north or south or west. Maybe going west from Studio takes me somewhere new, perhaps the Garage? Or going east might take me back towards the Kitchen?\n\nI need to track all the rooms visited so far: Home gym, Studio, and then maybe Bathroom or something else.\n\nBut now, after moving into the Cellar through some path, I have directions east and north. So from Cellar, if I go east, where does that lead? Maybe back towards another room like Living room?\n\nHmm. Wait, my goal is to visit all rooms with as few changes as possible. So maybe a map of the house would help visualize the layout.\n\nLet me try sketching this out mentally:\n\n- Home gym\n  - West: Studio\n  - South: probably Bathroom or maybe Garage\n\nFrom Studio:\n- North might lead back towards Home gym, which we've already visited.\n- South could take us to another room like Bathroom or maybe a different area.\n- West from Studio leads to another room, perhaps Garage.\n\nCellar is connected via east and north directions.

In Bathroom, check available directions.\n6. Suppose from Bathroom, going west or east might take me further, but need to see where that leads.\n7. Continue exploring each new direction until no more rooms are accessible.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to revisit rooms unless necessary.
