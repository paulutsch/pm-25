The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Home gym.

To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\n\nYou are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: south, west, east. What is your next command?\nGO: west\n\nFrom the previous response, I started by choosing to go west from the Home gym. Now, assuming that leads into a new room where further exploration is possible without backtracking, I should continue.\n\nAfter entering Room A (west of Home gym), I need to check the available directions. Let's say from Room A, available directions are east and north. \n\nSuppose going north from Room A leads into another room, Room B. From Room B, if there are more directions, perhaps south or west, which could lead to new rooms as well.\n\nContinuing this way, I should proceed until no new rooms can be visited in the current path before moving on to explore another direction from Home gym.\n\nSo, following that logic:\n\n1. GO: west\n2. From Room A, let's say north is available.\n3. GO: north → Room B\n4. From Room B, suppose east is available.\n5. GO: east → Room C\n6. From Room C, if south is available and leads to a new room, proceed.\n7. Once no more directions from Room C lead to new rooms, go back through the previous rooms towards Home gym.\n\nOnce all possible paths are explored without finding new rooms, I can return to Home gym or decide that there are no new rooms left to visit.\n\nAfter exploring west, then east, and finally south from each room, if all available directions have been exhausted without new rooms, then:\n\nDONE\n\nBut let's say after exploring west and east, the south direction still has more rooms. Then I would continue going south as much as possible, leading into another room with possibly no further directions.\n\nSo, considering that, here's how it might proceed:\n\n- After Room C (from Room B via east), if south leads to a new room D.\n- GO: south → Room D\n- From Room D, if available directions don't lead elsewhere, check if any previous rooms can be exited to find more rooms.\n\nIf no further directions are available from Room D and it's the last unvisited room, then:\n\nDONE\n\nThus, following this path ensures that all rooms are visited with the minimal number of room changes possible.\n\nFinal Answer:\nGO: west\nGO: north\nGO: east\nGO: south\nDONE", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:42:13.268480", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
