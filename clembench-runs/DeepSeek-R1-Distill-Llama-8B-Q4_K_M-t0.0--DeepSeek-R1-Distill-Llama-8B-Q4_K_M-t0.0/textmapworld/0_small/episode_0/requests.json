The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Starting from the Guest room, my current available direction is west. My goal is to move as efficiently as possible without changing rooms too often.\n\nFirst, moving west from the Guest room will take me somewhere new, probably another bedroom or similar. Once I get there, I should check the available directions again. If there are new directions, I'll have to decide which one to take next. The aim is to avoid making unnecessary changes because each change counts towards the total.\n\nI need to make sure that once I'm in a room with no new directions left to explore, I can stop and answer DONE. So, the plan is to always move towards an unvisited or less explored direction whenever possible, without backtracking unless necessary.\n\nIn this case, since from Guest room only west is available, my first move must be GO: west. After that, in the new room, I'll check directions again. If there's another option, like north, east, etc., I'll choose one that leads to more exploration with fewer changes.\n"}}], "created": 1748424619, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 307, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 536, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 11:30:19.370155", "call_duration": "0:00:14.410736", "response": "To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].
