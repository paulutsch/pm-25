The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Home gym.

I'm starting in the Home gym, and the only direction available right now is west. That means my first move should be GO: west.\n\nNow that I've moved west into the next room, which I don't know the name yet, I need to check what directions are available here. Let's say from the Home gym moving west leads me to another room, maybe a Bathroom or something else. Once I'm in this new room, I'll look at the available directions again.\n\nIf after moving west I find new rooms to visit, I should proceed by choosing one of the possible directions each time, trying to cover as many unique rooms as possible without unnecessary backtracking. If from that next room I have more directions to explore, I continue this process.\n\nI also need to be careful not to loop around rooms unless it's necessary for completing all rooms. Once there are no new rooms left to visit in any direction, I'll know to stop and answer DONE.\n"}}], "created": 1748424868, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 294, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 523, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 11:34:28.229838", "call_duration": "0:00:12.244383", "response": "To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].
