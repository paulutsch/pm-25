The primary objective is to explore all unique rooms without looping indefinitely.

Since both Gallery and Workshop have been visited, perhaps that's all there is to explore.\n\nBut the user mentioned \"you are in the Gallery\" again after moving east from Workshop, which suggests a cycle: Gallery → Workshop → Gallery → Workshop... But since both rooms have already been explored, the task should be complete once all possible directions from each room are exhausted without discovering new rooms.\n\nSo when I'm back at the Gallery with the same available directions (west and east), but no new rooms to visit, it's time to stop.
