	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Playroom. Currently available directions: north. What is your next command?

	 **Optimal Path Exploration Strategy:**\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Systematic Exploration:** From each room, explore each available direction in a predetermined order (e.g., alphabetical) to ensure thorough exploration.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Track Visited Rooms:** Maintain a record of all visited rooms to avoid revisiting them and inadvertently stopping the exploration prematurely.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Directional Exploration Order:**\\ \tt    - Start with the current room and choose one direction first.\\ \tt    - If moving in that direction leads to new rooms, continue exploring further directions from there.\\ \tt    - If no new rooms are found after exploring a direction, backtrack by choosing another available direction.\\ \tt    \\ \tt 4. **Termination Condition:** Once all possible directions from a room have been explored without leading to any new rooms, stop the exploration.\\ \tt \\ \tt By following this strategy, you can systematically explore each room with the fewest number of changes necessary, ensuring that all rooms are visited if possible.
