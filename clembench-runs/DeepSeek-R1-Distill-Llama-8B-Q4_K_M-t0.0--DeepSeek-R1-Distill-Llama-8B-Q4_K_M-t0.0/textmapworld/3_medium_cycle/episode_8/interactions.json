The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Begin in the \"Game Room\" with only direction available being \"south.\"\n2. Move south to enter the \"Bathroom.\"\n3. From the \"Bathroom,\" check available directions. Possible options are north (back to Game), south, and east.\n4. To explore all rooms, choose the least visited or unexplored direction next, which is east.\n5. Issue \"GO: east\" to proceed into a new room.\n6. After each move, recheck available directions to ensure no new rooms are missed.\n7. Continue this process until no new directions are possible, indicating all rooms have been visited.\n\n**Answer:**\nGO: south", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T12:23:46.767268", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
