	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Basement. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next command?

	 To solve the task of visiting all rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, follow this step-by-step plan:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Start at the Basement**: Begin your journey here.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Choose Directions Carefully**: At each new room, select directions that lead to unvisited rooms to avoid loops and ensure progress.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Explore West First**:\\ \tt    - From Basement, go west to the Music room.\\ \tt    - In the Music room, proceed east to the Bedroom.\\ \tt    - From the Bedroom, go south to the Kitchen.\\ \tt    - In the Kitchen, if possible, explore north towards a new area like the Lounge or other connected rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. **Explore East Next**:\\ \tt    - If not already visited, from Basement, choose east to a new room like the Dining room.\\ \tt    - From the Dining room, explore available directions such as south or north, leading to additional areas like the Living room or Garage.\\ \tt \\ \tt 5. **Continue Systematically**: Keep track of all rooms visited and systematically explore each direction until no new rooms are accessible.\\ \tt \\ \tt 6. **Recognize Completion**: Once all possible paths have been explored without new rooms being added, conclude by stating "DONE."\\ \tt \\ \tt By following this methodical approach, you ensure that you visit all rooms with the fewest changes necessary, covering all possible routes to avoid missing any rooms or getting stuck in a loop.
