Let's see, they provided three 5x5 grids. The first is the target, and the other two are distractors. My task is to describe the target in a way that differentiates it from the others.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each grid's structure. Starting with the target grid, it looks like there's an X pattern but not completely filled. Let me write it down:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X X\nRow 2: X □ □ X X\nRow 3: X X X X □\nRow 4: □ X X X X\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nHmm, looking at this, the target grid has a sort of checkerboard pattern but with some variations. Wait, actually, in each row, there's exactly one empty cell (marked as □). Let me check:\n\nRow 1 has the third column empty.\nRow 2 has the second column empty.\nRow 3 has the fifth column empty.\nRow 4 has the first column empty.\nRow 5 is completely filled with Xs.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Row 5 is all filled except for maybe a mistake? Let me double-check. No, user wrote it correctly: row 5 is X X X X X, so no empty cells. So target grid has exactly four empty cells, each in their respective columns.\n\nNow, looking at the distractor grids. Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: X □ X X X\nRow 2: X X X □ X\nRow 3: X X □ X X\nRow 4: X X X □ X\nRow 5: X □ X X X\n\nSo in this grid, the empty cells are moving around. It seems like a pattern where each row has one empty cell but their positions vary, not following a column-based rule.\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: X □ X □ □\nRow 2: X □ □ □ X\nRow 3: X □ □ X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ X X X\n\nHere, the empty cells are scattered in a less regular pattern. Some columns have multiple empty cells.\n\nSo the target grid is unique because each row has exactly one empty cell and these are aligned vertically—each column in rows 1 to 4 has one empty cell, but row 5 is entirely filled. Wait, no. Looking again, the empty cells are in column 3 of row 1, column 2 of row 2, column 5 of row 3, column 1 of row 4, and none in row 5.\n\nSo columns 1-5 each have exactly one empty cell except column 5 which has two? No: row 3 has empty at column 5, and row 5 is filled. So columns have:\n\nColumn 1: empty in row 4\nColumn 2: empty in row 2\nColumn 3: empty in row 1\nColumn 4: no empties\nColumn 5: empty in row 3\n\nSo each column has exactly one empty cell except column 4, which is fully filled. Hmm, but the target grid's columns 1-5 have one empty each except column 4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because target grid's row 4 starts with □, so column 1 has an empty in row 4; row 2: column 2; row 3: column 5; and row 1: column 3. So all columns have exactly one empty cell each except maybe some? Wait, no—columns are 5 in total, each with one empty cell.\n\nWait, let me list the empties:\n\nTarget grid empties:\n(1,3), (2,2), (3,5), (4,1), and none in row 5. So columns 1-5 have one empty each: column 1 has (4,1); column 2 has (2,2); column 3 has (1,3); column 4 has none; column 5 has (3,5). Wait no: column 4 has no empties in target grid because row 4's fourth cell is X. So columns 1-5 each have exactly one empty except column 4, which has none.\n\nBut looking at the distractors:\n\nDistractor 1: Each row has one empty cell, but they're spread out across all columns. The positions don't align per column as in the target.\n\nDistractor 2: Also has multiple empties per some columns but not as structured.\n\nSo perhaps the key feature of the target grid is that each column (except maybe one) has exactly one empty cell. Wait, no—target grid's columns have:\n\nColumn 1: empty at row4\nColumn 2: empty at row2\nColumn3: empty at row1\nColumn4: no empties\nColumn5: empty at row3\n\nSo each column except column4 has one empty. Column4 is fully filled.\n\nSo maybe the referring expression could describe that in the target grid, every column has exactly one empty cell except the fourth column, which is completely filled.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grids:\n\nTarget:\nRow1: X X □ X X\nRow2: X □ □ X X\nRow3: X X X X □\nRow4: □ X X X X\nRow5: X X X X X\n\nSo columns:\n\nCol1: row4 is empty\nCol2: row2 empty\nCol3: row1 empty\nCol4: all filled\nCol5: row3 empty\n\nSo each column has exactly one empty cell except col4.\n\nTherefore, the target grid has a unique property where each column has precisely one empty cell, except the fourth column, which is completely filled. So perhaps that's the key.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that the target grid's empty cells form a vertical alignment in columns but not rows. Wait, no—each row has exactly one empty cell spread across different columns.\n\nAnother angle: The target grid is the only one where every column contains exactly one empty cell except for the fourth column, which is entirely filled. So any referring expression describing that would uniquely identify it among distractors.\n\nLooking at Distractor1 and Distractor2:\n\nDistractor1:\nEach row has one empty cell, but they are not aligned per columns as in target. So each column could have multiple empties or none.\n\nDistractor2:\nEmpties are scattered differently; some columns have more than one empty, others none.\n\nSo the unique property is that the target grid's columns (except col4) each have exactly one empty cell.\n\nTherefore, the expression should state that all columns except the fourth column have exactly one empty cell, while the fourth column is fully filled.\n\nWait, but in target grid, only columns 1-5: col4 has no empties. So yes.\n\nSo perhaps the referring expression could be:\n\n\"The target grid has all columns containing exactly one empty cell, except for the fourth column, which is completely filled.\"\n\nBut to make it concise, maybe \"All columns contain exactly one empty cell except the fourth column, which is entirely filled.\"\n\nWait, but let me think if this is accurate. Column4 in target grid has no empties; all other columns have one empty each.\n\nYes, so that's the unique feature. So that would be a good referring expression.\n"}}], "created": 1748479603, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1603, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 1845, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-29T03:33:19.762066", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are given three grids, where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.\nGrids have empty cells marked with \"▢\" and filled cells marked with \"X\".\nYou are also given a referring expression that describes one of the given grids.\nYour task is to select the grid that matches the given referring expression.\nGenerate only the number (in text) of the grid that matches the given expression by selecting first, second, or third.\n\nFirst:\n\nX □ X X X\nX X X □ X\nX X □ X X\nX X X □ X\nX □ X X X\n\nSecond:\n\nX X □ X X\nX □ □ X X\nX X X X □\n□ X X X X\nX X X X X\n\nThird:\n\nX □ X □ □\nX □ □ □ X\nX □ □ X X\n□ X □ □ X\nX □ X X X\n\nExpression: The target grid has exactly one empty cell in each column, except for the fourth column, which is completely filled.\nQuestion: Which grid does the expression refer to?\nStart with the tag \"Answer: \", followed by your selection.

The expression says that the target grid has exactly one empty cell in each column, except for the fourth column, which is completely filled. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each grid looks like.\n\nGrid One:\n\nRow 1: X □ X X X\nRow 2: X X X □ X\nRow 3: X X □ X X\nRow 4: X X X □ X\nRow 5: X □ X X X\n\nSo, for Grid One, let's count the empty cells in each column.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow 1: X (filled)\nRow 2: X (filled)\nRow 3: X (filled)\nRow 4: X (filled)\nRow 5: X (filled)\nTotal filled: 5, so no empty cells. Wait, but the expression says each column should have exactly one empty cell except the fourth. That can't be right because Column 1 is completely filled.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nSo, only Row 1 is empty. That's one empty cell, which fits the condition so far.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: □ (empty)\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nAgain, only Row 3 is empty. So that's another column with one empty cell.\n\nColumn 4:\nThe expression says the fourth column is completely filled. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\nWait, in Grid One, Column 4 has empty cells in Row 2 and Row 4. That means it's not completely filled. So Grid One doesn't fit the expression because its fourth column isn't fully filled.\n\nMoving on to Grid Two:\n\nGrid Two:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X X\nRow 2: X □ □ X X\nRow 3: X X X X □\nRow 4: □ X X X X\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nLet's check each column.\n\nColumn 1:\nAll rows have X, except Row 4 which has a □. Wait, no:\n\nRow 1: X (filled)\nRow 2: X (filled)\nRow 3: X (filled)\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X (filled)\nSo Column 1 has only one empty cell in Row 4.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nOnly Row 2 is empty. So that's correct so far.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nSo Column 3 has two empty cells, which violates the condition of exactly one empty cell per column. Therefore, Grid Two doesn't fit.\n\nNow, Grid Three:\n\nGrid Three:\n\nRow 1: X □ X □ □\nRow 2: X □ □ □ X\nRow 3: X □ □ X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ X X X\n\nLet's check each column.\n\nColumn 1:\nAll rows have X except Row 4. Wait:\n\nRow 1: X (filled)\nRow 2: X (filled)\nRow 3: X (filled)\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X (filled)\nSo Column 1 has only one empty cell in Row 4.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: □ (empty)\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: □ (empty)\nWait, that's multiple empties. Let me count:\n\nRows 1, 2, 3, and 5 have empty cells in Column 2. That's four empty cells, which is way more than one. So Grid Three doesn't fit.\n\nWait a second, did I miscount? Let me recheck.\n\nIn Grid Three, Column 2:\n\nRow 1: □\nRow 2: □\nRow 3: □\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: □\n\nThat's four empty cells, which is not acceptable. So Grid Three is out.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with Grid Two. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn Grid Two, Column 1:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\nSo only one empty in Column 1, correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nOnly one empty, that's good.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nTwo empties, which is not allowed. So Grid Two doesn't fit.\n\nSo that leaves us with Grid One and Grid Three. But wait, earlier I thought Grid One's fourth column isn't filled. Let me double-check.\n\nIn Grid One:\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\n\nSo yes, in Column 4 of Grid One, there are empty cells. Therefore, it's not completely filled, so Grid One doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted Grid Two's columns. Let me make a table for each grid.\n\nFor clarity:\n\nGrid One:\nColumns 1 to 5:\n\nColumn 1: All Xs except Row 4 is □? No, in the initial description, Grid One's first row is X □ X X X, so Column 1 is all X. Let me correct that.\n\nWait no, I think I might have messed up earlier. Let me look again.\n\nGrid One:\n\nRow 1: X □ X X X\nRow 2: X X X □ X\nRow 3: X X □ X X\nRow 4: X X X □ X\nRow 5: X □ X X X\n\nSo, Column 1:\n\nRow 1: X (filled)\nRow 2: X (filled)\nRow 3: X (filled)\nRow 4: X (filled)\nRow 5: X (filled)\n\nNo empty cells in Column 1.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\n\nOne empty cell, correct.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: □ (empty)\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\n\nOne empty cell, correct.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\n\nTwo empty cells, which violates the condition. So Grid One doesn't fit because the fourth column is not completely filled.\n\nNow, Grid Two:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X X\nRow 2: X □ □ X X\nRow 3: X X X X □\nRow 4: □ X X X X\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:\nAll X except Row 4 is □, so one empty cell. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nOne empty cell. Good.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow 1: □\nRow 2: □\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\nTwo empty cells, which is a problem. So Grid Two doesn't fit.\n\nGrid Three:\n\nRow 1: X □ X □ □\nRow 2: X □ □ □ X\nRow 3: X □ □ X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ X X X\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:\nAll X except Row 4, so one empty cell. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: □ (empty)\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: □ (empty)\n\nFour empty cells, which is way more than allowed. So Grid Three doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that leaves me with no grid fitting the expression, but the question says one of them must match. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine Grid Two's Column 3. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nGrid Two:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X X → So Column 3, Row 1 is empty.\nRow 2: X □ □ X X → Column 3, Row 2 is empty.\nRow 3: X X X X □ → Column 3, Row 3 is X (filled).\nRow 4: □ X X X X → Column 3, Row 4 is X (filled).\nRow 5: X X X X X → Column 3, Row 5 is X.\n\nSo in Column 3 of Grid Two, only Rows 1 and 2 are empty. That's two empty cells, which again doesn't fit the condition of exactly one empty cell per column.\n\nHmm. Let me try to see if I misread the grids. Maybe I inverted some rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the referring expression refers to columns having exactly one empty cell, except for Column 4 which is completely filled. So each other column has exactly one empty cell, and the fourth column is all Xs.\n\nLooking back at Grid Two:\n\nColumn 4 in Grid Two:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: □ (empty)\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\n\nSo Column 4 has only one empty cell. But the expression says that Column 4 is completely filled. Therefore, even if the other columns have more than one empty, but in this case, since it's not fully filled either, Grid Two doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the expression. It says the fourth column is completely filled. So in all rows of Column 4, they must be Xs, with no empty cells.\n\nLooking at Grid One:\n\nColumn 4 has empty cells as well, so it's not fully filled.\n\nGrid Two: Column 4 also has an empty cell in Row 3, so not fully filled.\n\nGrid Three:\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\n\nSo two empty cells. Not fully filled.\n\nWait a minute, none of the grids have Column 4 completely filled. That can't be right because the problem states that one grid matches the expression.\n\nI must have misread the grids or the expression.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\nExpression: The target grid has exactly one empty cell in each column, except for the fourth column, which is completely filled.\n\nWait, maybe I misread which columns are which. Perhaps I'm considering Column 1 as first column, but maybe it's arranged differently, like from top to bottom.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grids have a different structure, like rows first.\n\nWait, no, typically in grids, it's row-wise from top to bottom, left to right. So the initial analysis holds.\n\nBut since all three grids don't have Column 4 fully filled, I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me check Grid One again:\n\nGrid One's fourth column (Column 4):\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: □ (empty)\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\n\nSo two empty cells. Not fully filled.\n\nGrid Two, Column 4:\n\nRow 1: X\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: □ (empty)\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\n\nOne empty cell in Row 3. So not fully filled.\n\nGrid Three, Column 4:\n\nRow 1: □ (empty)\nRow 2: X\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: □ (empty)\nRow 5: X\n\nTwo empty cells.\n\nSo none of them have the fourth column completely filled.\n\nWait, perhaps the referring expression is that each column, including Column 4, has exactly one empty cell. But no, the expression says \"except for the fourth column,\" implying it's entirely filled.\n\nHmm, maybe I misread the grids. Let me look again.\n\nGrid One:\n\nRow 1: X □ X X X → So Column 5 is X in Row 1\nRow 2: X X X □ X → Column 4 is empty here.\nWait, so in Column 4 of Grid One, there's an empty cell in Row 2 and Row 4.\n\nSo no, it's not fully filled.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nWait, perhaps I have to consider that \"exactly one empty cell in each column, except the fourth column which is completely filled.\" That would mean each other column has exactly one empty, and the fourth column has none (all X).\n\nLooking back, maybe I miscounted the empty cells in other columns.\n\nGrid One:\n\nColumn 1: all Xs. So zero empty cells, but should have exactly one. Therefore, Grid One doesn't fit.\n\nWait no, the expression says each column except the fourth has exactly one empty cell. So Column 1 must have exactly one empty, same for Column 2, 3, and 5 (assuming fifth is another column). Wait, maybe I miscounted columns.\n\nLet me clarify: in a 5x5 grid, there are five columns, from left to right as Column 1 to Column 5.\n\nIn the expression: \"exactly one empty cell in each column, except for the fourth column, which is completely filled.\"\n\nSo:\n\n- Columns 1,2,3,5: exactly one empty cell each.\n- Column 4: no empty cells (all X).\n\nLooking at Grid Two again:\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:\n\nOnly Row 4 is □. So one empty.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nOnly Row 2 is □. One empty.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRows 1 and 2 are □, so two empties. Not okay.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 3 is □, but according to the expression, Column 4 shouldn't have any empty cells. So Grid Two doesn't fit because Column 4 has an empty cell.\n\nWait, so none of the grids might fit. But that can't be.\n\nLet me check Grid Three again.\n\nGrid Three's columns:\n\nColumn 1:\n\nOnly Row 4 is □ (empty). One empty, correct.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRows 1,2,3,5 are □. Four empties. Not okay.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRows 1,2,3 are □. Three empties. Not okay.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow 1 and Row 4 are □. Two empties. Not okay.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRows 1,2,3 have X except in Row 5? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nGrid Three's rows:\n\nRow 1: X □ X □ □ → Column 5 is □ (empty)\nRow 2: X □ □ □ X → Column 5 is X\nRow 3: X □ □ X X → Column 5 is X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X → Column 5 is X\nRow 5: X □ X X X → Column 5 is X\n\nSo in Column 5:\n\nRows 1 has empty, others have X. So only one empty cell. So Columns 1 and 5 each have exactly one empty cell.\n\nBut Column 2,3,4,5? Wait, no, columns are 1-5. Wait, the expression is about all columns except the fourth having exactly one empty.\n\nIn Grid Three:\n\nColumn 1: one empty\nColumn 2: four empties → not okay\nColumn 3: three empties → not okay\nColumn 4: two empties → not okay\nColumn 5: one empty\n\nSo only Columns 1 and 5 fit, which is insufficient.\n\nWait, maybe I have to consider that the fourth column being completely filled implies that in Column 4, no cell is □, all X. So let's see:\n\nGrid One:\n\nColumn 4 has two empties → doesn't fit.\n\nGrid Two:\n\nColumn 4 has one empty → doesn't fit.\n\nGrid Three:\n\nColumn 4 has two empties → doesn't fit.\n\nSo none of the grids have Column 4 completely filled.\n\nBut the problem states that one grid does match, so I must be making a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine Grid Two's Column 3 again. In Grid Two:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X X\nRow 2: X □ □ X X\nRow 3: X X X X □\nRow 4: □ X X X X\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo Column 3:\n\nRow 1: empty\nRow 2: empty\nRow 3: X\nRow 4: X\nRow 5: X\n\nThat's two empties in Column 3. So not okay.\n\nWait, perhaps the fourth column is considered as the fifth? Maybe I miscounted columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"fourth\" refers to the fifth column.\n\nBut in a 5x5 grid, numbering the columns from left (1) to right (5).\n\nIf so, Column 5 would be the fifth, which would mean that all rows in Column 5 must be X, except for one? But no, the expression says \"exactly one empty cell in each column, except for the fourth column, which is completely filled.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's a vertical column. So the fourth column from the left is Column 4.\n\nBut as per previous analysis, none of them have that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me number the columns from top to bottom.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of rows and columns differently.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each row has exactly one empty cell except for the fourth row? Or something else.\n\nNo, the expression is about columns.\n\nI must be missing something. Maybe \"exactly one empty cell in each column\" includes Column 4, which would then have to have exactly one empty cell as well. But the expression says except for Column 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread: maybe it's that the fourth column has completely filled, but each of the other columns has exactly one empty cell.\n\nSo:\n\n- Columns 1,2,3,5: each has exactly one empty cell.\n- Column 4: no empties (all Xs).\n\nLooking again:\n\nGrid One:\n\nColumn 4 has two empties → not okay.\n\nGrid Two:\n\nColumn 4 has one empty → doesn't fit because it's supposed to have none. So no.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is that the fourth column is completely filled except for one cell? No, the wording says \"completely filled.\"\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look at which grid has Column 4 as all Xs except possibly one cell.\n\nBut in the given grids:\n\n- None have Column 4 as entirely Xs. All have at least one empty cell in Column 4.\n\nTherefore, maybe the expression is misinterpreted by me.\n\nAlternative interpretation: each column (including the fourth) has exactly one empty cell, and the fourth column is also filled except for that one empty.\n\nBut no, the wording says \"except for the fourth column, which is completely filled.\"\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the time I've spent, maybe the answer is Grid 2: Second grid.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggests it doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in Column counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first grid fits:\n\nGrid One:\n\nEach column (except fourth) has exactly one empty.\n\nColumn 1: all X → zero empties → no.\n\nSo it doesn't fit.\n\nSimilarly for Grid Three:\n\nColumns:\n\n1: Row 4 is empty → one\n2: many empties → not okay.\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to choose the second grid, even though my analysis says otherwise, because maybe I missed something.\n"}}], "created": 1748482167, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 4439, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 4704, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}]
