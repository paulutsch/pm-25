Let me look at all three grids first.\n\nThe target grid is 5x5, and looking at each row: the first four cells are always X's except for the fifth cell, which is empty (□). So the pattern here seems to be X, X, X, □, □ in every row. Wait no, actually, it's X, X, X, □, □—that's five cells per row, right? Or maybe each row is X X X □ □. Hmm, that's five columns.\n\nLooking at the target grid more carefully:\n\nRow 1: X X X □ □\nRow 2: same as above.\nAnd so on for all five rows. So every row has three X's followed by two empty cells.\n\nNow Distractor Grid 1 is similar but in each row, the fifth cell is an X instead of a □. So it's X X X □ X in each row. So the last column alternates between □ and X. Wait no, actually, looking closer: Each row ends with X. For example:\n\nRow 1: X X X □ X\nRow 2: same pattern.\n\nSo Distractor Grid 1 has all rows ending with X instead of having two empty cells at the end. So in D1, columns 5 are all X's except the first and third maybe? No, wait, it's all X's because in each row, the last cell is X.\n\nDistractor Grid 2 seems different. Its structure is X X X X □ in every row. So each row has four X's followed by a □. So all rows have only one empty cell at the end, and no filled cells beyond that. Also, each column from 1 to 4 is fully filled with X's.\n\nSo the target grid is different because it has two empty cells in each row, whereas D1 ends each row with an X, making it have only one empty cell per row but all in the same position (column 5). And D2 has four X's and a single □ at the end of every row.\n\nWait, no. The target grid has three X's and two □'s in each row, but those □'s are columns 4 and 5. So in each row, columns 4 and 5 are empty, while D1 only has a single □ at column 5. Wait, no—actually, the target grid's rows have three X's followed by two □'s, so positions 1-3 are filled, and 4-5 are empty.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nTarget grid row: X X X □ □ (columns 1-3: X, columns 4-5: □)\nDistractor Grid 1: each row is X X X □ X (columns 4: □, column 5: X)\nDistractor Grid 2: each row is X X X X □ (columns 1-4: X, column 5: □)\n\nWait no, the target grid's columns are:\n\nRow 1: [X, X, X, □, □]\nRow 2: same\n...\nSo for each row in the target, cells 1-3 are filled, and 4-5 are empty.\n\nIn D1, each row is X X X □ X, so column 4 is □, column 5 is X.\n\nIn D2, each row is X X X X □, so columns 1-4 are X, column 5 is □.\n\nSo the target grid's columns 4 and 5 have empty cells in every row, but D1 has only column 5 as empty in each row, while D2 has only column 5 as empty, with columns 1-4 filled. Wait no: In D2, columns 1-4 are X's and column 5 is □. So in the target grid, columns 1-3 are X, then columns 4-5 are □.\n\nSo to describe the target, it's about having two empty cells at the end of each row, while all other cells are filled except for the first three columns.\n\nWait, no: Target grid has three X's and two □'s per row. So in each row, cells 1-3: X; cells 4-5: □.\n\nIn D1, each row is X X X □ X, so cell 4 is □ and cell 5 is X. Only one empty cell in each row.\n\nD2 has four X's followed by a single □, so again only one empty cell per row but at the end of five columns.\n\nWait no: In D2, it's X X X X □, so in each row, cell 5 is □, cells 1-4 are X. So that's four filled and one empty in each row.\n\nThe target grid has three X's and two empties per row.\n\nSo the key differences:\n\n- Target: Each row ends with two empty cells (columns 4 and 5)\n- Distractor 1: Each row ends with one empty cell (column 4) and an X (column 5)\n- Distractor 2: Each row has four filled cells (columns 1-4) and one empty cell (column 5)\n\nSo the target is unique because in each row, there are two empty cells at positions 4 and 5. Neither of the distractors have two empties per row.\n\nTherefore, a referring expression should mention that in every row, columns four and five are empty, while all other cells are filled. Additionally, it's important to note that this pattern is consistent across all rows.\n"}}], "created": 1748474306, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1250, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 1492, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}]
