You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:18:30.952630", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This guess includes a letter known to be correct ('a' from apple) placed correctly in second position and 'p' possibly elsewhere.\nguess: caped", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:18:30.953436", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = audio\nguess = caped\nguess_feedback = c<red> a<yellow> p<red> e<red> d<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:18:30.953586", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> a<yellow> p<red> e<red> d<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:19:06.667958", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: After receiving feedback that 'c', 'p', and 'e' are incorrect in certain positions, and knowing that 'a' is correct but misplaced, as well as 'd' being possible but not correctly positioned, the next guess \"glade\" avoids these letters and places 'a' and 'd' appropriately.\nguess: glade", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:19:06.668270", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = audio\nguess = glade\nguess_feedback = g<red> l<red> a<yellow> d<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:19:06.668426", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: g<red> l<red> a<yellow> d<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:21:01.970991", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback from \"glade,\" where 'a' and 'd' are correctly included but misplaced, and 'g,' 'l,' and 'e' being incorrect, the next guess includes letters known to be correct ('a' and 'd') in positions that align with previous hints.\nguess: crane", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:21:01.971658", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = audio\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:21:01.971955", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-28T16:24:23.281064", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "The strategy here is to build on the feedback from the previous guesses, specifically focusing on confirmed correct letters ('a' and 'd') while avoiding those marked as incorrect or misplaced.
