Let me start by going through each round step by step. \n\nFirst, my initial guess was \"apple\". The feedback given was a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>. So, breaking this down:\n\n- 'a' is yellow: So the first letter isn't correct; there's another 'a' somewhere else in the word.\n- Both 'p's are yellow: The first 'p' is not correct, but the second 'p' is in the wrong position.\n- The third letter 'p' is green, meaning it's correct and in the right spot.\n- 'l' is yellow, so it's present but misplaced.\n- 'e' is red, so 'e' isn't part of the word.\n\nWait, but hold on. The feedback shows that there are two 'p's: the first p is in position 2, which is yellow, and the second p in position 3 is green. That means the correct letter for position 3 is 'p', so I can note that down. \n\nSince the third letter is 'p' and it's correct, maybe the target word has a 'p' in the middle somewhere.\n\nLooking at other letters: The 'a' is yellow, so another 'a' exists elsewhere. The 'e' is red, so the word doesn't contain 'e'. So no 'a' or 'e' beyond what's already been considered.\n\nNow, the next guess was \"banana\". The feedback for this was b<red> a<yellow> n<yellow> a<n<green> n<red>. Let me parse that:\n\n- 'b' is red: So 'b' isn't in the word.\n- Both 'a's are yellow: So they're present but not in their positions. The first 'a' is position 2 and the second 'a' is position 4, both yellow.\n- 'n's are tricky here: Position 3 is yellow, meaning it's present elsewhere, and position 5 is red, so no 'n' there.\n\nWait, but the feedback also shows a <green> in position 6. Oh, I think I misread it earlier. Let me check again.\n\nIn \"banana\", the feedback was b<red>, a<yellow>, n<yellow>, a<n<green>, n<red>. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \"banana\" is six letters and the target word is five letters. Oh, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait no, maybe I misread it. Let me clarify: The feedback for \"banana\" should be for each letter in order. So 'b' at position 1 is red, then 'a' at position 2 is yellow, 'n' at position 3 is yellow, 'a' at position 4 is green? Wait, no, because in the initial feedback, it's a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>. So each letter is being checked against the target.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to figure out based on the feedback for \"banana\":\n\n- 'b' is red: So target doesn't have a 'b'.\n- First 'a' is yellow: So there's an 'a' elsewhere in the word.\n- Second letter 'n' is yellow: So there's an 'n' but not in that position.\n- Third letter 'a' is green? Wait, no, the feedback for \"banana\" was a<yellow> n<yellow> a<n<green> n<red>. Hmm, perhaps I misread the letters.\n\nWait, maybe the feedback for each guess needs to be correctly aligned. For example, in the second guess of \"banana\", each letter's feedback is given positionally.\n\nSo, let me structure it:\n\nGuess: b a n a n a\nFeedback:\n1: b<red>\n2: a<yellow>\n3: n<yellow>\n4: a<green>\n5: n<red>\n6: a<red>\n\nBut since the target word is five letters, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the feedback for \"banana\" as a six-letter guess isn't applicable because the target is only five letters.\n\nWait, no, Wordle allows guessing up to six attempts with words of five letters. So the guess \"banana\" would be considered against a five-letter word. But that can't be right because \"banana\" is six letters. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the feedback for \"banana\" is structured correctly as per the target's five letters, so each position corresponds to the guessed letter. So let me assume that the guess was \"banana\", but it's only five letters? No, \"banana\" is six letters. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the feedback example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to focus on the feedback given and not get stuck on how the guess fits into a five-letter word.\n\nIn any case, from the feedback for \"banana\", I can gather that 'b' is incorrect, both 'a's are present but misplaced, and some 'n's are correct or not. \n\nBut perhaps it's better to move on. The third guess was \"abana\". The feedback is a<yellow>, b<red>, a<green>, n<yellow>, a<red>. So:\n\n- 'a' at position 1 is yellow: So the target has an 'a', but not here.\n- 'b' is red: Not in the word.\n- Second 'a' is green: Correct, so this 'a' is correctly placed.\n- 'n' is yellow: Present elsewhere.\n- The last 'a' is red: So incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's an 'a' in position 2 (since it's green), and perhaps another 'a' elsewhere, but not at the end. \n\nSo, putting together:\n\nFrom \"apple\", I know there's a 'p' in position 3, so target word has 'p' at index 3.\n\nFrom \"banana\", 'b' is incorrect, so no 'b's.\n\nFrom \"abana\", second letter is correct 'a', and another 'a' elsewhere.\n\nSo now, the feedback from these three guesses would help narrow down possible words.\n\nLet me try to think of five-letter words that fit:\n\n- Contains 'p' at position 3.\n- Does not contain 'b'.\n- Contains 'a's in some positions, possibly more than once.\n- Doesn't have 'e' as per the first guess.\n\nPossible words: \"caper\" (has 'p'), \"apera\" (has 'a's and 'p'), \"pacer\", \"caped\", etc. But need to ensure they fit the feedback.\n\nWait, maybe I should list possible words with 'p' in the middle (position 3) and no 'e', two 'a's perhaps.\n\nSo, possible options: \"caper\" - letters C A P E R; but 'e' is present. Wait, from the first guess, 'e' was red, meaning it's not in the target word. So \"caper\" is out.\n\nAnother word: \"panda\" - has 'p' in position 3 (since positions are 1-based). Wait, no, \"panda\" is P A N D A. Position 1 is 'P', so that's not matching the feedback from \"apple\", where the first letter was 'a' (position 1) and it's yellow, meaning target has another 'a' elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with positions. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the initial guess \"apple\":\n\n- a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nSo position 1: 'a' is wrong (target has an 'a' elsewhere)\nPosition 2: 'p' is yellow, so target has 'p' but not here\nPosition 3: 'p' is green, correct\nPosition 4: 'l' is present elsewhere\nPosition 5: 'e' is incorrect.\n\nSo the target word must have:\n\n- A 'p' in position 3.\n- An 'a' somewhere else (since first letter's 'a' was yellow)\n- Another letter that is 'l' and 'e' but not in those positions, and no 'b'.\n\nSo possible words:\n\n- \"caped\": C A P E D → has 'p' at position 3, 'e' which would make the last 'e' red as per feedback. But since the feedback for 'e' was red, it's incorrect. So \"caped\" is out.\n\n- \"apera\": A P E R A → but from \"apple\", the second 'p' (position 3 in this case) is correct? Wait no: In \"apple\", position 2 is 'p', which was yellow; position 3 is 'p' which was green. So in the target, the third letter must be 'p'.\n\nIn \"apera\": A P E R A → positions:\n\n1: A – from \"apple\", the first 'a' is yellow, so this might fit as it's correct (but maybe not if there are other 'a's)\n2: P – in \"apple\", position 2 was 'p' which is yellow, but here position 3 must be 'p', so this word would have 'p' at position 2, which doesn't align with the feedback from \"apple\". So maybe not.\n\n- \"cappa\" → C A P P A: has two 'p's, but I think we can eliminate that because in \"apple\", the second 'p' was yellow, and the third 'p' was green. So target word must have one 'p' at position 3. Thus, \"cappa\" might be possible, but it's six letters? No, wait, no: \"cappa\" is five letters: C A P P A → letters 1-5.\n\nBut let me check feedback for \"cappa\":\n\nIf target is \"cappa\", then:\n\nFrom \"apple\": 'a' is yellow (correct, since position 1 would have 'c', not 'a'), so that's okay.\n\nPosition 3: 'p' is correct as green. So that fits.\n\nBut in \"cappa\", the second and third letters are both 'p's. So from \"apple\", the feedback was p<yellow> p<green>, meaning that position 2 was 'p' (wrong) and position 3 was 'p' (correct). But in \"cappa\", position 2 is 'a', so it doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating too much. Let me think of words ending with 'a' since the feedback from \"abana\" suggests that the fourth letter was 'n' and fifth was 'a' as red, which might mean target has an 'a' in position 4 or earlier but not at 5.\n\nWait, no: In \"abana\", the feedback for each letter is:\n\n1: a<yellow>\n2: b<red>\n3: a<green>\n4: n<yellow>\n5: a<red>\n\nSo, position 3 (third letter) is 'a' in guess \"abana\" and it's green. So target word has 'a' in position 3.\n\nFrom the first guess, \"apple\", the third letter was 'p', so in the target word, position 3 is 'a'? That can't be because from \"apple\", p<green> means position 3 is correct as 'p'. But according to \"abana\"'s feedback, position 3 is 'a' and green. This seems contradictory unless there's a mistake.\n\nWait, that can't be both. Either I'm misunderstanding the feedback or making a mistake here. Let me clarify: In the initial guess of \"apple\", feedback was p<green> at position 3, meaning target word has 'p' in position 3. Then in the third guess of \"abana\", position 3 is 'a', which was marked as green, so target must have 'a' in that position. But this is conflicting because it can't be both 'p' and 'a'.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there's an error in my understanding. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the initial guess was \"apple\", feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>.\n\nSo position 1: 'a' is wrong, but target has an 'a'.\nPosition 2: 'p' is wrong, but target has a 'p' elsewhere.\nPosition 3: 'p' is correct (green).\nPosition 4: 'l' is present but not in that spot.\nPosition 5: 'e' is incorrect.\n\nThen the second guess was \"banana\", feedback: b<red> a<yellow> n<yellow> a<n<green> n<red>.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I misread this earlier. Let me parse it correctly:\n\nFor \"banana\" (letters: b, a, n, a, n), the feedback per position would be:\n\n1: b <red>\n2: a <yellow>\n3: n <yellow>\n4: a <green>\n5: n <red>\n\nSo the target word has an 'a' at position 4 and possibly another 'n'.\n\nBut from \"apple\", we know that position 3 is 'p', so in \"banana\", position 3 is 'n', which was yellow, meaning it's present elsewhere. But in the target word, position 3 is 'p', not 'n'. So perhaps the feedback for \"banana\" doesn't align with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up letters. Let me try to list possible words again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- From \"apple\": p at position 3.\n- No 'b's.\n- Has 'a' somewhere else (since position 1 was a<yellow>).\n- No 'e's.\n- Possible 'l's but feedback was l<yellow>, so maybe another 'l' elsewhere, but not in that position.\n\nSo possible letters: must include 'p' at position 3, have an 'a', no 'b's or 'e's. Let me think of five-letter words fitting these criteria.\n\nExamples:\n\n- \"caper\": C A P E R → has 'p' at position 3, 'a' at position 2, but from \"apple\", the first letter was 'a' and it was yellow, so maybe target has another 'a'. However, \"caper\" has only one 'a'.\n\n- \"apera\": A P E R A → starts with 'a', which would conflict with \"apple\"'s feedback where position 1 was 'a' and yellow. So if the target has an 'a' not at position 1, that's okay.\n\nWait, but in \"apera\", position 3 is 'e', which from \"apple\" feedback, 'e' was red (incorrect). So \"apera\" would have 'e' in position 3, which is incorrect. Thus, it can't be the target.\n\nAnother example: \"pagan\": P A G A N → has 'a's at positions 2 and 4, but position 1 is 'P', which from \"apple\", position 1 was 'a' yellow, so that might fit since there's an 'a' in position 2. But does it have a 'p' at position 3? No, it has 'g' instead. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe \"paris\": P A R I S → no 'e's, but from \"apple\", position 3 was 'p', which is correct here (position 1). But from \"apple\"'s feedback, the first letter 'a' was yellow, so target has another 'a'. \"Paris\" has an 'a' at position 2.\n\nBut does it fit all criteria? Let's check:\n\n- From \"apple\": a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n   → Target must have:\n      - p in position 3\n      - another 'a'\n      - no 'b', 'e'\n\nFrom \"banana\": b<red> a<yellow> n<yellow> a<n<green> n<red>\n   → Target has 'a' at position 4 (from feedback a<n<green>?) Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of words that have:\n\n- 'p' in the middle.\n- At least two 'a's.\n- No 'b', 'e'.\n\nPossible word: \"capra\": C A P R A → has 'a's at 2 and 5, 'p' at position 3.\n\nCheck against feedback from \"apple\":\n\n- Position 1: 'c' vs 'a' → yellow (since target has an 'a').\n- Position 2: 'a' is correct? Wait, in \"apple\", position 2 was 'p' which was yellow. So if target has 'a' at position 1 or elsewhere, but from \"apple\"'s feedback, the first letter's 'a' was wrong (yellow), meaning target's first letter isn't 'a', so it must be another 'a' somewhere else.\n\nSo in \"capra\", 'a's are at positions 2 and 5. From \"apple\": position 1 is 'c', which would not conflict with the initial feedback, as target has 'a' elsewhere (positions 2 and 5). That seems possible.\n\nBut does \"capra\" fit all feedback?\n\nFrom \"banana\"'s feedback: b<red>, so no 'b's. a<yellow> suggests that there's an 'a' in target but not at position 2 of \"banana\", which is the second letter. So in \"capra\", positions 2 and 5 are 'a's, so position 2 would be correct if it's 'a', but in \"banana\"'s feedback, the second letter was 'a' (from \"banana\") being yellow, meaning target doesn't have 'a' at that position. Thus, \"capra\" has 'a' at position 2, which might conflict.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the second guess (\"banana\"), feedback for each letter is provided based on the target word, not the guess itself. So when you make a guess, you get feedback about how your letters compare to the target. Therefore, each guess's feedback applies only to that specific guess.\n\nTherefore, in \"banana\"'s case:\n\n- b: red → target has no 'b's.\n- a (second letter): yellow → target has an 'a' not in this position.\n- n (third letter): yellow → target has an 'n' not in this position.\n- a (fourth letter): green → target has an 'a' at this position.\n- n (fifth letter): red → target doesn't have 'n's here.\n\nSo from \"banana\"'s feedback, we know that:\n\n- There is exactly one 'a' in the fourth position.\n- One 'n' elsewhere (but not in third or fifth positions).\n- No 'b's.\n- No 'e's.\n\nFrom this, let's update our criteria for the target word:\n\n- Must have an 'a' at position 4.\n- Have another 'a' (since \"apple\" suggests there's another 'a' because position 1 was a<yellow>).\n   → So total two 'a's: one in position 4, and one elsewhere (not position 1).\n- Must have a 'p' at position 3.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- From \"apple\", l<yellow> → target has an 'l' not in the fourth position.\n- From \"banana\"'s feedback, n is only allowed in certain positions.\n\nSo let's see: word with five letters, starting with any letter (but likely not 'a' because of \"apple\"'s feedback for first letter).\n\nBut wait, from \"apple\", position 1 was 'a', which was yellow, so target has an 'a' elsewhere. So the word can't start with 'a' if that's conflicting.\n\nWait no: in \"apple\", the guess is a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>. That means:\n\n- Position 1 ('a') is wrong (so target doesn't have 'a' there).\n- Target has an 'a' somewhere else.\n\nSo if our target word has 'a' in position 4, as per \"banana\"'s feedback, then the other 'a' can be elsewhere, but not in position 1.\n\nAlso, from \"abana\"'s feedback:\n\n- a<yellow> (position 1): so target doesn't have 'a' there.\n- b<red> (position 2): confirms no 'b's.\n- a<green> (position 3): so target has an 'a' here. Wait, but earlier from \"apple\", we had position 3 as 'p' which was green, meaning it should be correct. Now this is conflicting.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because different guesses are giving conflicting feedbacks. Let me try to approach this methodically.\n\nEach guess provides specific information based on how the target compares to that guess. So each piece of feedback is relative to the target word.\n\nTherefore, let's list all feedbacks and extract the necessary info:\n\n1. Guess: apple → feedback a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n   - Position 1 ('a'): wrong → target does not have 'a' at position 1.\n   - Target has one 'a' elsewhere (since it's yellow in position 1, which is wrong).\n   - Position 2 ('p'): wrong but correct elsewhere → target has a 'p' in another position (but not here; since it's yellow, so 'p' exists somewhere else.\n   - Position 3 ('p'): correct → target has 'p' at position 3.\n   - Position 4 ('l'): correct elsewhere → target has an 'l' in another position.\n   - Position 5 ('e'): wrong → no 'e's in the target.\n\n2. Guess: banana → feedback b<red> a<yellow> n<yellow> a<n<green> n<red>\n   - Position 1 ('b'): wrong → no 'b's in target.\n   - Position 2 ('a'): correct but not here → target has an 'a' elsewhere (since it's yellow).\n   - Position 3 ('n'): correct elsewhere → target has an 'n' somewhere else (not here; since it's yellow, so only one 'n').\n   - Position 4 ('a'): correct → target has 'a' at position 4.\n   - Position 5 ('n'): wrong → no 'n's in this position.\n\nFrom the second guess, we know that:\n\n- The word has an 'a' in position 4 (from a<n<green>).\n- There is exactly one 'n' and it's not in positions 3 or 5; so the only possible 'n' is in position 1. Wait, but from \"apple\"'s feedback, position 1 cannot be 'a', but if target had an 'n' there, that would fit. However, let me check:\n\nBut wait, no: the second guess's feedback for position 3 was 'n<yellow>', meaning that in the guess (which is banana), the third letter was 'n', which in the target word doesn't mean it's correct; rather, it's yellow if there's an 'n' somewhere else but not at this spot.\n\nWait no: in \"banana\", position 3 is 'n'. Feedback for this letter is 'n<yellow>', meaning that target has an 'n' elsewhere but not here. So the target can have one 'n', possibly in position 1 or others, but not in positions 3 or 5 (since position 5 was 'n' and feedback was red, meaning incorrect).\n\nWait, no: In \"banana\"'s feedback:\n\n- Position 5 ('n') is red → target doesn't have an 'n' at position 5.\n\nSo the only possible 'n's in target are at positions 1 or 3? But wait, from \"apple\"'s feedback, position 3 was 'p<green>', meaning that position 3 in the target is 'p', so it can't be 'n'.\n\nThus, the only possible place for an 'n' in target is position 1. So target starts with 'n'? Let me check:\n\nFrom first guess (apple), position 1 was 'a' and feedback was yellow → target has 'a' elsewhere, but not at position 1. From second guess's feedback, target must have 'a' at position 4, and an 'n' elsewhere (but not in certain positions).\n\nWait, this is conflicting because if target starts with 'n', then from first guess's feedback, it doesn't start with 'a', which is okay.\n\nBut let me outline possible letters now:\n\n- Position 1: can be any letter except 'a'.\n   From second guess, \"banana\", position 1 was 'b' and feedback red → target has no 'b's, so position 1 can't be 'b'.\n   Also, from second guess, since there is an 'n' in the target (from a<n<green> in position 4), but position 5 of \"banana\" had 'n' and it was red. So target must have one 'n'.\n\nSo possible letters for position 1: n, c, d, etc., but from first guess's feedback, no 'b's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure the information:\n\n- Position 3 is 'p' (from apple).\n- There is an 'a' at position 4 (from banana).\n- The word has exactly one 'n', which must be in position 1 because from \"banana\", 'n<yellow>' (position 3) and 'n<red>' (position 5), so target's only 'n' can't be at position 3 or 5. Therefore, it must be at position 1.\n\nSo word starts with 'n', has 'p' at position 3, and 'a' at position 4.\n\nWhat about the remaining positions: 2 and 5?\n\nFrom \"apple\"'s feedback:\n\n- Position 2 ('p') was wrong (yellow), so target doesn't have 'p' here.\n   But from second guess (\"banana\"), position 4 is 'a', which is correct, and position 2 in \"banana\" is 'a' which was yellow → target has an 'a' elsewhere, which could be position 4.\n\nSo remaining letters for positions 2 and 5: considering that no 'b's, no 'e's, and from first guess, position 5 is 'e' which is wrong → so position 5 can't be 'e'.\n\nAlso, from \"apple\"'s feedback on position 4 ('l'): target has an 'l' elsewhere. So target must have one 'l', not in position 4 (which is 'a').\n\nSo let's see: word structure:\n\nPosition 1: n\n\nPosition 2: ?\n\nPosition 3: p\n\nPosition 4: a\n\nPosition 5: ?\n\nAnd must include exactly:\n\n- One 'n' at position 1.\n- One 'p' at position 3.\n- One 'a' at position 4.\n- One 'l' somewhere (not position 4).\n- Also, from \"banana\", an 'a' in position 2? Wait no: in \"banana\"'s feedback for position 2 was 'a<yellow>' → target has an 'a' elsewhere. Since we know that position 4 is 'a', the 'a' in target is accounted for.\n\nWait, but how many 'a's are in the target word? From first guess, apple had a<yellow> (position 1 wrong) and the 'a' could be at another position. Second guess confirmed an 'a' at position 4, so only one 'a'. So that's okay.\n\nNow, letters left: positions 2 and 5 need to be filled with two different letters, neither of which can include 'a', 'p', 'n', or 'e', 'b'.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nFrom first guess, position 4 in apple was 'l' and it was yellow → target has an 'l' somewhere else. So target includes one 'l', which hasn't been placed yet.\n\nSo possible letters for positions 2 and 5: must include an 'l', and another letter.\n\nAlso, from \"apple\", the feedback for position 5 ('e') was red → target doesn't have 'e'.\n\nSo:\n\nLetters in target word so far: n, p, a, l.\n\nWait, no:\n\nLetters accounted for:\n\n- Position 1: n\n- Position 2: ?\n- Position 3: p\n- Position 4: a\n- Position 5: ?\n\nMust include:\n\n- One 'l' somewhere (since from apple, position 4 was 'l', which was yellow → target has an 'l' elsewhere).\n\nSo if we have n _ p a _, then the remaining two letters must include one 'l' and another letter. Also, from \"banana\"'s feedback, position 3 in guess was 'n' and feedback was yellow → target doesn't have 'n's elsewhere except position 1.\n\nAlso, no 'e's or 'b's.\n\nSo possible letters for position 2 and 5:\n\n- Since we must include an 'l', and the other letter can be any remaining lowercase letter not used yet.\n\nPossible options: n is at 1, p at 3, a at 4. So letters left could be l, c, d, etc.\n\nWait, but from \"apple\", position 5 was 'e' (incorrect), so we know target doesn't have 'e's.\n\nSo let's think:\n\nIf I consider that position 2 is 'l', then position 5 must be another letter. Or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to make a possible word: n l p a something. Wait, but maybe n l p a s? No, because from \"apple\", we can't have an 's' unless it's accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about known words that fit this structure.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n\n- 5 letters.\n- Starts with 'n'.\n- Ends with something that isn't 'e'.\n- Has exactly one 'a' at position 4.\n- Has a 'p' at position 3.\n- Includes an 'l' somewhere, but not at position 4.\n\nPossible word: \"n-l-p-a-s\" → but s is allowed unless there's feedback against it.\n\nWait, let me think of possible words:\n\n- napalas? No, that's six letters.\n- Maybe nopal? No, that ends with 'l' and would be four letters.\nWait, perhaps n l a p something. Wait, no: position 4 must be 'a'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"n-l-p-a-s\" → but s is allowed.\n\nWait, maybe the word is \"naplas\"? But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"nlpas\" or similar.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try to think of an actual English word. Let me brainstorm:\n\n- Words starting with 'n' and having letters p, a, l somewhere.\n\nPossible words: napkin → but that would have 'k', which we don't know about yet, and position 4 is not 'a'.\n\nWait, maybe \"n-l-a-p-s\"? No, that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"naplha\", but that has too many letters. Hmm.\n\nThis approach isn't working; perhaps I need to think differently. Let me recap:\n\nWe have to construct a 5-letter word starting with 'n', having 'p' at position 3, 'a' at position 4, and one 'l' elsewhere (either positions 2 or 5).\n\nAlso, from \"apple\"'s feedback, no 'e's.\n\nSo possible letters for the remaining spots: position 2 and 5 must contain 'l' and another letter, say 'c'.\n\nThus, word could be n-l-p-a-c → \"nlpa c\" but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, n-c-p-a-l? That would be \"nCPAl\", which seems like a random string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is \"n l p a something else\". Wait, perhaps \"n-l-p-a-s\"? But I don't know if such a word exists.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"n-l-a-p-?\" No, position 4 must be 'a'.\n\nHmm. Maybe \"n-l-p-a-d\" → \"nlpad\", but that doesn't ring a bell as an English word.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct word is \"n-l-a-p-s\"? But I don't think so.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"n-p-l-a-?\" No, position 3 must be 'p', so third letter fixed.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in my approach.\n\nWait, let me consider that the word might have two 'l's? But no, because from apple, the feedback for 'l' was yellow (position 4), meaning target has an 'l' elsewhere. So if target had another 'l', we would have seen it in feedback. So only one 'l'.\n\nWait, but according to first guess (\"apple\"), position 4 is 'l' which was yellow, so target must have an 'l' somewhere else.\n\nSo we already accounted for that.\n\nWait, perhaps the word is \"n-l-p-a-s\" and s is allowed because there's no feedback against it yet. But I'm not sure if such a word exists as a valid English word. Alternatively, maybe \"naplas\" is correct, but that might have an incorrect ending.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is \"napkin\", but that would have 'k', which wasn't in any of our guesses, so we don't know about it. Also, position 4 in \"napkin\" is 'i', not 'a'.\n\nWait, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n\n- Starts with 'n' (from banana's feedback)\n- Ends with something that isn't 'e'.\n- Contains exactly one 'a' at position 4.\n- Contains exactly one 'p' at position 3.\n- Contains exactly one 'l', which is not in position 4.\n\nSo letters present: n, p, a, l, and another letter (let's say x).\n\nPossible combinations for the fifth letter: we need to ensure that no feedback is conflicting. Also, from \"apple\"'s feedback, we have an 'e' at position 5, which was red → so target doesn't have 'e' there.\n\nSo if the word ends with a letter other than 'e', possible endings are any of a-z except 'e'.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nPosition 1: n\n\nPosition 2: ?\n\nPosition 3: p\n\nPosition 4: a\n\nPosition 5: ?\n\nWe must include an 'l' either at position 2 or 5.\n\nSo let's try both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Position 2 is 'l', so word is n l p a x.\n\nPossible fifth letter 'x' can be any except 'e'.\n\nLet me think of possible words:\n\n- \"nlpass\" → doesn't make sense.\n- \"nlpaax\"? No, too long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth letter is 's', making \"nlpas\".\n\nIs there an English word \"nlpas\"? Not that I'm aware of. It's not a standard word.\n\nCase 2: Position 5 is 'l', so word is n x p a l.\n\nPossible letters for position 2 can be any except 'a', 'p', 'n', or causing duplicates.\n\nSo position 2 could be 'c' → \"ncpal\".\n\nIs \"ncpal\" an English word? No, I don't think so.\n\nAlternatively, position 2 as 'd' → \"ndpal\". Not a word I recognize.\n\nWait, perhaps the word is \"n-l-p-a-s\" → nlpas. Alternatively, maybe it's \"naplas\", but that would require 'p' at position 3 and 'l' somewhere else.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct word is \"n-l-p-a-h\". But again, not a recognized word.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the target word is \"napkin\", which doesn't fit because the fourth letter would be 'k'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"nappal\" → n a p p a l. No, too many letters and duplication of 'p's.\n\nWait, but in our constraints, we can only have one 'l' elsewhere.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to think of other possible starting points or perhaps my initial assumptions about the first guess are wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct first guess isn't \"n-l-p-a-s\" because that's not a real word. Maybe I need to consider that my first guess is incorrect and pick another one.\n\nWait, but according to Wordle rules, you get feedback after each guess, so maybe starting with a common word makes more sense.\n\nBut the initial example was \"apple\". So maybe the correct first guess should be \"apple\", which is a common word.\n\nLet me try that. Let's suppose I start with \"apple\".\n\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nguess: apple\n\nNow, feedback would be something like:\n\na<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nWait, but the actual feedback can vary. Let's suppose that in this case, 'e' is incorrect (as it was in position 5 of \"apple\"), and 'p's are correct as they are in positions 2 and 3. Wait, no: in \"apple\", position 1 is 'a', which might not be in the target word. So feedback would indicate if 'a' is present or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about a different approach for generating the first guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"civic\" is a good starting point because it's another common five-letter word with vowels and consonants.\n\nBut without knowing the target word, this might be difficult. Alternatively, I could use logic based on letter distribution in English words.\n\nWait, perhaps the most common five-letter English words start with 'c', 'n', or other letters. But without specific data, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"think\" is a good first guess because it includes unique letters like 't' and 'h'.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe starting with \"apple\" as in the example makes sense.\n\nSo after choosing \"apple\", the feedback would indicate which letters are present and where.\n\nIn this case, suppose the feedback for \"apple\" is:\n\n- a: yellow (present but in wrong position)\n- p: green (correct position)\n- l: yellow (present but wrong position)\n- e: red\n\nWait, but in \"apple\", both 'p's are at positions 2 and 3. If one of them is correct and the other isn't, that would affect feedback.\n\nThis could help narrow down which letters to include or exclude in the next guess.\n\nAlternatively, if I got \"apppx\" as feedback (for some x), I can adjust accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps I need a better strategy for choosing the next word based on feedback.\n\nWait, let's say after \"apple\", feedback shows that 'a' is correct but not in position 1. So the actual word has an 'a' elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, if both 'p's are green or yellow, indicating their presence.\n\nBut without knowing the exact feedback, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should pick a word with unique letters to maximize information gain.\n\nWait, perhaps \"dogma\" is another good starting point because it includes distinct letters like 'd', 'o', 'g', 'm', 'a'.\n\nBut again, without knowing the target, this is guesswork.\n\nI think I need to start with a common word and proceed from there. So my first guess would be \"apple\", as suggested in the example.\n"}}], "created": 1748445521, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 8649, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 8887, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-05-28T17:28:34.069163", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!

Let's see where we are after the first guess.\n\nThe initial guess was \"apple,\" and the feedback was a<red> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<green>. Wait, that doesn't match up with what I thought earlier. The user mentioned a specific feedback: a<red>, p<red>, p<red>, l<red>, e<green>. Okay, so each letter is either red or green.\n\nFirst off, \"a\" is <red>. That means the target word doesn't have an 'a' in any position. So we can eliminate words with 'a's. Next, both 'p's are <red>, so there are no 'p's in the target word. So another letter to cross out is 'p'. Then 'l' is <yellow>. That means there's an 'l' in the correct position somewhere, but since all other letters except 'e' and 'l' are red, perhaps 'l' is correct but not necessarily in this position.\n\nThe 'e' is <green>, which means it's in the right place. So the target word has an 'e' as its fifth letter. So far, we have a 5-letter word ending with 'e', no 'a's or 'p's, and somewhere there's an 'l'.\n\nSince 'e' is correct at the end, maybe \"le...\" could be part of the word. Also, since 'a', 'p', and another 'p' are wrong, we need a different starting letter.\n\nSo possible letters to use next: considering the feedback, letters not yet used in the guess might include letters that appear in yellow or green, which can help narrow down possibilities.\n\nWait, in this case, only 'l' and 'e' have given any useful info. 'l' is correct but position unknown, and 'e' is correct at the end.\n\nSo perhaps starting with a letter that's not used yet would be better. The guess before was \"apple,\" which has 'a', 'p's, so maybe next I can try something else.\n\nWait, the user mentioned in their example feedback: guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>. But then in the current scenario, they have a different feedback. Maybe I need to focus on that.\n\nIn this case, with the feedback given (a<red>, p<red>, p<red>, l<red>, e<green>), we can start by noting each letter's status. Since 'e' is correct and in place, and all others are incorrect, maybe I can structure the next guess around that.\n\nSince 'l' is <yellow>, perhaps there's an 'l' elsewhere but not at position four. So in a 5-letter word ending with 'e', if we have an 'l' somewhere else, maybe in positions one, two, or three.\n\nBut since all other letters are red, the target doesn't contain 'a', 'p's, and has only 'e' as green, with 'l' being yellow elsewhere. So possible words could be \"blee\" but that's not a word. Or maybe \"balee\" or \"lebel\", but those don't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the target is \"bubble\"? No, because that would have multiple letters, and we need to check if 'p' is present. But according to feedback, 'p' is red, so not in the target word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"bluee\" but that's not a valid word either. Hmm.\n\nMaybe \"bleep\" isn't correct because it has more letters and also uses 'p'. So perhaps I should think of other words ending with 'e', without any 'a's or 'p's.\n\nWait, the word could be \"bake,\" but that ends with 'e' but has 'a' which is red. No, can't have 'a'.\n\nWhat about \"cake\"? Again, includes an 'a'. So that won't work.\n\nMaybe \"fame,\" but that doesn't use any of the guessed letters except 'e' at the end. But wait, \"fame\" is a 4-letter word, so not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"muse,\" but again, only 'e' at the end and no other letters from the guess. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps \"nurse\" ends with 'e', but has an 's' which wasn't guessed yet. Also, includes 'u', which is new.\n\nBut I need to think of a word ending with 'e', with 'l' somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe \"table,\" no because it doesn't end with 'e' and starts with 't'. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, \"bottle\" is too long. \"bubble\" as before has 'p's which are red. So perhaps I need to find a word that ends with 'e', has an 'l' somewhere else, and doesn't have any 'a's or 'p's.\n\nHmm, maybe \"affle\"? No, has 'a' again. \"affle\" is not correct.\n\nWait, could it be \"affle\"? But no, because we know 'a's are red.\n\nWait, maybe \"affle\" isn't a word. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nSince the feedback says that both 'p's and 'a' in the guess were incorrect, and only 'e' is correct at the end, perhaps the target is a word like \"leave,\" but that would have an 'l', which was yellow, so maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Since all letters except 'e' are red, and 'l' is yellow, meaning it exists elsewhere.\n\nSo in position five, we have 'e'. The fourth letter must be 'l'. So the word ends with 'e' and has an 'l' somewhere else. So perhaps \"leee\" but that's not a word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"blee\", but again, not a real word. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the target is \"blue,\" which is 4 letters, so no. Alternatively, \"bake\"—no 'a'.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should think of words ending with 'e', with an 'l' before it in another position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second letter is 'l'. So something like * l e? But first letter can't be 'a' or 'p', so could be 'b', 'c', etc.\n\nWait, but we need a 5-letter word ending with 'e'.\n\nSo perhaps \"blee\" as a guess. But again, not a real word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is \"bale,\" but that's four letters and has 'a', which is red. So no.\n\nWait, another approach: since all letters except 'e' and 'l' are incorrect, and we have to use feedback, perhaps the next guess can include letters not guessed yet, such as 't', 'h', etc., while also considering the feedback about 'l' being correct but in a different position.\n\nSo maybe the next guess would be \"table,\" but it's 5 letters ending with 'e'. Wait, does that have an 'l'? Yes, \"table\" ends with 'e' and has 'l' in position three. But also includes 'a', which was red in our first feedback. So including 'a' might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can exclude letters already used.\n\nWait, in the feedback for \"apple,\" all letters except 'e' were incorrect. So that means the target word doesn't have 'a's or 'p's. So maybe starting with 'b', 'c', etc., but how does this help?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Perhaps I should make another guess based on what we know: target has 5 letters, ends with 'e', contains an 'l' somewhere else, no 'a's or 'p's.\n\nWait, \"fable\" is a 5-letter word ending with 'e' but includes 'a'. Not good. \"amble\"—does that work? Ends with 'e', has 'm', 'b', etc., but also 'a', which is incorrect based on feedback. So no.\n\nAlternatively, \"inkle\"? Doesn't end with 'e'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the next guess should be \"inkle\" or \"indle\", but not sure if those are valid.\n\nI'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I need to think of other possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the target is \"bubble,\" but again, that has 'p's which are incorrect in feedback. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"gale,\" but that's 4 letters. Or \"bake\" is also wrong because of 'a'.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I need to think of other words ending with 'e', without 'a' or 'p's, and containing an 'l' elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe \"fleek\"? Not a real word. \"Freek\"? No, that's not valid either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"bleep\" isn't correct as it has more letters, but also uses 'p' which is incorrect in feedback.\n\nWait, so I'm struggling to find a 5-letter word ending with 'e', containing an 'l' somewhere else, without any 'a's or 'p's. Maybe the answer is \"leapp,\" but that includes 'a's again.\n\nWait, no—given all letters except 'e' and 'l' were red in feedback, maybe I need to consider that the word has only 'e' and 'l', but with 'l' not at position four.\n\nSo perhaps \"leave\"—but that's 5 letters ending with 'e', has an 'l' as second letter. But does that make sense? Wait, but \"apple\" feedback said no 'p's, so \"leave\" is okay because it doesn't have any 'a's or 'p's. Also, the 'l' in position two would be correct if in target.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I should try a new approach.\n\nSince the guess feedback says all except 'e' and 'l' are wrong, perhaps I need to focus on words with only those letters? But that seems limiting.\n\nWait, maybe \"leem\" is not a word. Or \"leek,\" but no, it doesn't end with 'e'.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nGiven that the target has 5 letters, ends with 'e', includes an 'l' somewhere else, and excludes 'a's and 'p's, perhaps the word is \"blueh\" or something, but no, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"fence\"—but that includes 'c' and 'e' but not necessarily 'l'.\n\nAlternatively, \"glove\" ends with 'e', has 'v', 'o', etc., but also 'l'. But again, how does this fit?\n\nI'm probably overcomplicating this. Maybe I should think of possible words that fit the feedback and make an educated guess based on that.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the next guess is \"inkle\"—it ends with 'e' (assuming it's a typo for 'leek'), but not sure if that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"affle\" was wrong because of 'a', so perhaps another word without 'a'.\n\nWait, I think I need to take a different approach. Maybe list possible words that fit the feedback and select one based on that.\n\nSo, target word: 5 letters, ends with 'e', contains an 'l' elsewhere, no 'a's or 'p's.\n\nPossible options:\n\n- \"blee\" (unlikely)\n- \"clef\" (ends with 'f')\n- \"dele\" (doesn't have 'l' except at end)\nWait, but de-le? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"affle\" is incorrect due to 'a'. So, perhaps \"affle\" is out.\n\nMaybe \"galee\" is too long or not a real word.\n\nThis is tough. Maybe I should consider that the only letters used are 'l' and 'e', but even then, it's challenging.\n\nGiven all this, maybe my next guess would be \"blee,\" but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n"}}], "created": 1748445986, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2655, "prompt_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 2968, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}]
