The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

I just started in the Craft Room and can only go south right now. Hmm, where does that lead me?\n\nWait, the user mentioned starting in the Craft Room with available direction south. So my first move has to be south. Let me think about what's south from there. Maybe it's a new room I haven't been to before, like maybe an Office or something? \n\nBut without knowing the exact layout, I guess I should proceed as much as possible until no new rooms are left. Each time I go south, I'll add that room to my graph and update the directions available. If going south from the Craft Room leads me somewhere else, I can continue exploring from there.\n\nI also need to make sure that each step is recorded with the correct action and the updated graph. So after moving south from Craft Room, say it's an Office, then in the next step, I'll be in the Office and check what directions are available there. \n\nIt might loop or lead me back to a previously visited room, which would mean I can't go further. At that point, when there are no new rooms to visit, I should answer \"DONE\". But until then, keep moving south unless another direction becomes available.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, only south is possible. So first action is definitely GO: south. Then from wherever I land, check for new directions and proceed accordingly.\n"}}], "created": 1748434550, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 402, "prompt_tokens": 439, "total_tokens": 841, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-05-28 14:15:50.537528", "call_duration": "0:00:17.236970", "response": "To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].
