You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: \"___ tomorrow\" (sammy kaye hit)\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-c75v12anvtd6wufdrgmf6", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nexplanation: The clue \"___ tomorrow\" likely refers to the Sammy Kaye hit song \"Tomorrow,\" which is a five-letter word fitting the criteria.\n\nguess: tomorrow", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "reasoning_content": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve Wordle based on the given clue. The clue is \"___ tomorrow\" and it mentions a Sammy Kaye hit. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the words could be from the hint. The first part is blank in the clue, which suggests that there are some letters missing but the overall structure hints at something related to \"tomorrow.\" The mention of Sammy Kaye makes me think of a song or an artist known for hit songs, so maybe the word is associated with a popular track.\n\nSince it's about a five-letter word and a Sammy Kaye hit, I'm thinking about possible words that fit this context. One well-known song by Sammy Kaye is \"Tomorrow,\" which is part of The Partridge Family's version. The word \"Tomorrow\" itself is five letters long, so that fits the criteria.\n\nBut wait, the clue starts with \"___ tomorrow.\" It could be suggesting a compound or a phrase where \"tomorrow\" is part of it. However, since we're dealing with a single five-letter word, \"Tomorrow\" seems like the most likely candidate.\n\nLet me consider if there are other possibilities. Could it be something like \"Tomorro\"? No, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe \"Tommorow,\" but that's six letters and has double Ms, which might not fit as cleanly.\n\nGiven that, \"Tomorrow\" is a strong possibility because it's a well-known song by Sammy Kaye, fitting the clue perfectly. It meets both the letter count and the reference to a hit song. Therefore, I'll go with \"tomorrow\" as my guess.\n"}}], "created": 1748446835, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 381, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 666, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}]
