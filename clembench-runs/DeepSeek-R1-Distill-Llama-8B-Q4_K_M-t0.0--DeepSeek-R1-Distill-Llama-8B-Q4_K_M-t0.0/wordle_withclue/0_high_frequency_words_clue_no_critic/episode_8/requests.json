You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-11sr316xspye5js4h85nu3l", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\n\nI chose \"heart\" because it's a common word that might relate to a song released in 1985. The band Heart had several hits around that time, which could make \"heart\" the target.

The clue is \"1985 hit by heart.\" Hmm, I'm not sure how that connects directly to the target word. Maybe it's about a famous song or artist from 1985? Wait, Heart is a band. Oh! Maybe they had a hit in 1985 called \"Heart\" or something related. Let me think of some songs. There's \"These Dreams,\" which I think was released around that time. But does the word fit? Let me consider how many letters. \"These Dreams\" has five letters, but I'm not sure if it's the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Heart\" itself is the target because it's a common word and might be part of a song title or something. Or perhaps it's referencing \"Heart Attack,\" which was a hit around that era. Wait, that's two words. Maybe the first word is what they're going for. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but I think \"heart\" could fit since it's a single word and might be associated with a song from 1985.\n"}}], "created": 1748446822, "model": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "lmstudio-community/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 585, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "stats": {}}}]
