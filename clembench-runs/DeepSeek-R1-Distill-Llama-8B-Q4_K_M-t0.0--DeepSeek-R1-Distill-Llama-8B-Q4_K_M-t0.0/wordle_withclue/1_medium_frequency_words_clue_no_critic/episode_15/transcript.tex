	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: adder or asp\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue provides two words related to snakes, suggesting the target word is connected to them. Given both "adder" and "asp" are four and three letters respectively, the target word must be a five-letter word that incorporates elements from these words. Considering possible combinations and related meanings, "adder" itself might not fit, so I infer it's best to choose "saint" as it's a common five-letter word starting with 'a,' though it doesn't directly relate to snakes.\\ \tt guess: saint

	 explanation: The feedback from "saint" indicates that all letters except 'i' are incorrect or misplaced. This means I should avoid using 's', 'a', 'n', 't' again in my next guess. Considering the clue "adder or asp," which are related to snakes, I need a five-letter word connected to snakes but not starting with those letters. After evaluating possible options like "python" and "cobra," I decide on "cobra" as it relates to snakes and doesn't use any of the previously incorrect letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: cobra
